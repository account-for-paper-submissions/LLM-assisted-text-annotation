0,352,Hands down best food I’ve had in London. Amazing flavours in every dish that made me go WOW. Inventive use of meat parts(tongue etc). Received a hand written card from the team to celebrate our birthday which was a nice touch! Vibe is quite formal. I am dreaming of the day I can come back for another visit!,1
1,560,Still one of the best meals we've had in the UK. It did help the sun shone and we sat on the terrace. The wine selection was one of the most memorable pairings we've ever had.,0

4,31,"Good restaurant, but the service died when we started with desserts (no more water, had to ask for the bill...)

Bread and butter was excellent.

The chocolate dessert was way to powerful.",0

6,198,"Dame De Pic is a two Michelin starred French restaurant situated by Tower Bridge tube station in central London. The restaurant is situated within a top hotel and specialises in Southern/South East French cuisine. Which is understandable as Chef Pic is from that heritage. My wife and I visited in July 2021 for our wedding anniversary.

Pros:
The food is stupendous. Tasty. Creative. And a sight and wonder to behold. For the taste buds, the eyes, and for all the senses indeed. Furthermore, service is impeccable. The staff are friendly, professional, courteous yet impeccably trained and oh so knowledgeable on the restaurant's various dishes. Most impressive. I was most impressed by Stephanie, Art and Walter especially. Job well done! I especially liked the attention to detail by the team. Stephanie's team noticed I was on my wedding anniversary meal and took appropriate action. Most impressive! I have decided I will spend my anniversaries here every year from henceforth! Imagine if you came here to propose marriage to your loved one!

Cons: None really. Prices are fair in view of the quality of the food and establishment. Lovely high ceilings. Staff did not rush me at all. The soap dispenser on the left hand side ran out of soap in the men's toilet, but really, I can't find any flaw or fault in the restaurant. Well done!

In short, Dame De Pic is the London outpost of Chef Pic's international Michelin starred gastronomic empire and serves superb French food. I had a great time there, would recommend it unreservedly and look forward to visiting them again soon for great tasting French food. Well done guys!",1

8,107,"I so wanted to give this full marks, as we had very high expectation for a 2 star restaurant.

Sadly, I have to mark it down for one fundamental failure.

We opted for the Journey tasting menu with pairing (@ £120 per person), which they delivered by the chef with each dish. HOWEVER, the timings  and delivery of each pairing was wrong, and it ruined the experience of each dish ( which is the point of paring option). The pairings were served 10-15 mins before each course, and with many of the pairings needing to be serviced chilled, they were warm by the time the food arrived. This completely ruined our experience.

After getting the attention of our waiter, he continued to time his pour wrong.  Finally we spoke to one of the senior managers, who informed me that the kitchen failed to communicate with front of house, and offered our cocktails on the house as an apology.

Sadly, it doesn’t rectify the failure, and at a cost in excess of £600.",0
9,711,The steak was excellent and the decor was refreshing. I would recommend.,0
10,1020,"The tasting menu was good, as could not be less in this category, but both the service and the dishes are below this level.",0
11,992,"From the attention upon arrival, to the visit to the winery, the staff, 10.
Especially Adolfo and Mariano, the sommelier.
Exceptional food.
It's a shame that it takes us so far away and that it's so expensive.
But is it worth it.
These enjoyments raise morale.
Ah! I forgot. We ate at the table next to the kitchen, watching the pace and pace of the staff.
Unforgettable",1
12,158,"Luxurious lunching at La Dame de Pic
London has no shortage of excellent restaurants and the city hosts some fine examples of gastronomy taken to the next level. La Dame de Pic at the opulent Four Seasons hotel at Ten Trinity square is a venue set to impress the most discerning of diners. Anne-Sophie Pic is one of the World’s most decorated female Michelin star chefs and this truly beautiful restaurant is befitting of her culinary excellence.

Upon arrival at the Four Seasons hotel, we were instantly impressed by the tasteful grandiosity of the building. Deep carpets felt pleasing under foot and the tall walls featured an artistically crafted fresco set into the plaster. We passed garlands of fresh flowers to enter the central bar, featuring a grand piano at the middle of its lavish rounded room. This building was formerly the Port of London Authority headquarters and retains much of its original décor. La Dame de Pic features high ceilings and columns set with bevelled mirrors, bathing the restaurant with natural light. Guests are given plenty of space and seated on rich leather furniture. We got a glimpse of the intimate private room, which reflects the charm of the building and can accommodate 14 guests for a truly special dining experience. The venue is impressive without being stuffy and the warm, attentive staff are very relaxed and welcoming.

Anne-Sophie Pic has a reputation for producing exceptional dishes and we couldn’t wait to sample her creations. The restaurant features several menu options, ranging from a set lunch menu starting at a very reasonable £32 for two Michelin Starred courses, to an indulgent six course tasting menu, for those wanting a truly heavenly experience. We picked a four-course lunch option which featured a tour de force of cooking. The fresh cheese gnocchi paired with a velvety-smooth pepper emulsion and wild mushrooms was an amazing opener. The foie gras terrine was the richest we’ve tasted, melting on the palette with a pineapple and cardamom chutney. A Scottish scallop with smoked beetroot and grapefruit was cooked to other-worldly standards, converting a former beetroot avoider to rave about this course. A duck breast smoked with vanilla was the most perfectly cooked example we’ve tasted, with the fat beautifully rendered and the meat pleasingly pink and juicy. A delicate fillet of Cornish Brill was perfectly complimented by roasted cauliflower and a smooth coriander beurre blanc. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of the Chestnut Baba dessert, you simply must taste it for yourself.

La Dame de Pic is a luxurious restaurant we’d wholeheartedly recommend to our clients. This is a must for impressive lunches, elite corporate dining and private events where only the best will do.",0
13,377,Amazing meal. Great service. Had a blust. Would love to come back again.,0
14,765,"Great food and attentive service. Elena, the head chef, came out to say hello to us, which was a nice touch. Lovely experience overall, might be lacking a wow factor for a 3 star Michelin experience.",1
15,789,"Heritage.
That's what you think when you choose Arzak Restaurant. Of course the story (history) is very important, but first of all the purpose of the visit is food and stile of cooking.
You will not find something here, and if you will visit some fine dining places in Bilbao and Basque Region your experience will be much better. Quality of cooking maybe the subject of discussion, but bones in duck meat is a failure.
The egg course (this time marble) is perfect, no starch (potato) opens new flavours of this popular in fine dinning course.",0
16,614,"On the pricy side, also a waiting list to book here, but absolutely worth it. I also own their cookbooks, but more like coffee table books. A lot of time and effort goes in to these recipes.",0
17,365,"Every dish is impeccable. I had the oyster cream of Chantilly, cod, lobster wrapped in shiitake, and the brown sugar tart as dessert.

The cream of Chantilly was refreshing and holds all the flavors. The cod was cooked to perfection. And I was surprised by the use of tapioca in the sauce and yet it accompanied the fish very well. My favorite was the lobster. I’ve never thought it goes so will the the shiitake. The mushroom tasted like the sun dried ones and added a trace of bitter sound flavor to the lobster. Such food pairing is not even common in Eastern Asian dishes. The brown sugar tart tastes like creme brûlée and the best part of the dessert is the stem ginger ice cream. It’s spicy to the exact right strength.

The service is attentive the nice. I don’t mind if it’s a bit more casual.",0
18,783,"As you'd expect, superb food, great atmosphere and a relaxed environment. Tasting menu was well balanced but I was a little disappointed they didn't have a wine pairing. Well worth the visit if you're in town!",0
19,932,"One of the best dining I've experienced and I also goto the chance to have a picture with the Chef Arzak himself. Ammazing people, amazing service, amazing food. Just fantastic.",1
