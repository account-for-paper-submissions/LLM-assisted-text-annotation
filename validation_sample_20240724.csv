515,"The best dining experience I have ever had. The food was incredible, great produce fabulously executed. The staff were fantastic. Impeccable service, i really can not fault anything.",0
120,"Amazing!! Food was so delicious. Superb presentation. High cuisine techniques and flavour combinations. Incredible value for money - 3 dish set lunch at a 2 Michelin star restaurant in central London for £45 - an absolute bargain! Complementary starters (3 different bite size eats), complementary bread and flavoured butter, and complementary tarts. Super nice and profesional staff. Great ambience and lots of natural light and space. I cannot fault it. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.",0
47,"Delicious, balanced taste. Not cheap (you can go on a small holiday from this) but one of the best meals I ever had! You close your eyes if you taste this. Although this establishment might seem a bit chique/stuck-up (has been around for lots of years), the staff is really nice and you get great views also.",0
894,Nice to see Mr Arzak come out and talked to each table.,1
208,"Absolutely fantastic food, very good staff, better than most 3 Michelin restaurants in London.",0
586,The Ledbury specializes in French and English cuisine. Enjoy the exotic appetizers such as amuse-bouche to extraordinary main course seafood recipes and the signature brown tart desserts. The Ledbury offers a great range of desserts and also widely popular for its specialties.,0
256,"The most beautiful, instagramable food you will find. Service also perfect. Taste and paired wines are ok. Balance of flavours often a bit off (eg too much citrus with everything for our taste, especially in winter). Decor and Muzak also not quite our taste.",0
376,Only my second time at the Ledbury and it didn’t disappoint. Innovative cuisine which changes on a regular basis unlike a lot of other Michelin starred restaurants. Not a large restaurant so be sure to book in advance.,0
792,"A great experience as always! Not only love the food, but services is superb and they make you feel at home. Thank you
Pd I’m a vegetarian, so they created an as hoc menu that could be envied by the others 😉 …",0
399,The staff is friendly and informative. We have a great experience there. The menu is creative and we discover new flavor from their dish.,0
770,"Tasting menu, amazing food and good service. English is still a bit of a challenge and that takes away something from the experience if one does not talk Spanish. Great respect for produce: little done to let them shine. Loved the amuse with chicken, the avocado ice cream was something out of this world and the duck was absolutely perfectly cooked. The marbled egg something to try again. Good wines as well to complement the dinner.",0
160,"Had a lot of food allergies so can’t have the tasting menu, just ordered wagyu main and mille fluille for dessert, too filling. They did serve you some small “welcoming treats”, which is nothing special. I came here alone for no special occasion, just want to taste the food and it’s convenient to reach here. Have to say wagyu was too greasy, when I had even fatter kobe wagyu in Japan it was not so greasy that I couldn’t finish, I know the chef already did her best, the companion veg was refreshing but the amount was too little so couldn’t match the beef.
The dessert was made of “special yogurt cream” but I still find it too greasy. I am not an extremely picky person, but maybe that night I just chose wrong dish. Hopefully there will be special occasion that someone ask me to come here again to have a different experience.
The service was good, avoided all my allergies. I heard that the table next to me highly praised the wine and bread, they ordered a lot recurrently. Unfortunately I don’t drink alcohol, so can’t enjoy the speciality here.",0
716,One of my favour restaurant in London.  The services and the foods are excellent.,0
200,"Excellent and very floral cuisine.
Unfortunately the coffee was quite poor, especially for a restaurant with such standards.
Knowing this, you can choose from a sublime tea selection though.",0
432,"The Ledbury really is worth a visit to forget about the outside world and to be spoilt and enjoy some fantastic plates of food.
One feature to this restaurant is that all the tables have a great view next too the large windows.
We started the meal with a glass of champagne with an abundant selection of canapés.The high lights of the meal for me being the chalk stream trout with shiso and the muntjac dear….the grated heart on a piece of aubergine was so creamy and smoky and the dumpling  to with hints of spruce.
We finished the meal with some blackcurrant pastille rolled in some exotic sugar that my brain has erased and the classic chocolate truffle all elevated with the Ledbury twist.
We also had the pleasure to meet Brett and thank him for looking after ourselves and our son who had been before.
One member of staff of note was Josh who was a pleasure to be served by….keep doing what you do….and thank you.",1
634,"Simply amazing, wife & I visited during our holiday we ate the Beef Short Rib & Filet & it's possibly the best steaks I've ever had",0
764,"If I could give 6 stars I would! Arzak was the most incredible fine dining experience of my life so far. The food was of course exceptional with the pigeon being a highlight: it was outstanding. What elevated Arzak was the homely, friendly feel: it was a joyous evening in which I not only enjoyed the food, but smiled throughout because of the friendly and good humoured service. We had the tasting menu, but this was tailored to ensure we both had individual experiences; albeit shared. Without question one of the highlights of my gastronomic journey so far. Thank you!",0
692,Best meal I’ve had in London. Service is exemplary as well.,0
938,"I have to commend Elena Arzak for successfully balancing the reputation of her father, who is now just a distant memory, from the new cooking she has brought in. While the team is still largely the same: Mariano, the sommelier, has been working there for 38 years, the dishes bring a fantastic new wave of ideas and flavors. Wonderful work and Arzak is back on my top list.",1
321,"👍The Best of the Best restaurant…👍 TOP RECOMMENDATION!!! Based on what you celebrate 🥳 , everything was so delicious 8 courses 🤤, well supplement of in house mushrooms and prepared with pleasure by chef Mr. Graham it self “Red-book mushrooms” if I can call them like that as I haven’t tasted anything like that before, always smart approach with highest attention to details…
Top Top Top of the best!!!!
In regards to price, well priced but worth!!!",0
27,"All in all it was a great evening. Got to see the sunset during the meal and nice concept with all the different spices around the world. There were several dishes though that were overly salted and I thought three courses of dessert was a bit heavy. I would’ve been happy with only the first one, with the nice clean citrusy note to end the evening. Just my two cents.",0
618,"They have amazing food, probably the best in London. Although its a bit costly, but totally worth it. Couldnt have been better.",0
248,"Sadly it was a huge disappointment. Our first waiter ( with spikey hair) had an issues with offering me gluten free items/ I am allergic to options - he made faces when I said I cannot have beetroot amuse-bouche - I cannot. After forgetting about the orders 4th times he seemed to lose his patience and basically threw my little plate on the table which I took in silently due to respect to other guests.
Our glasses were never filled up with water without asking, we were waiting 3 times for Evian more than 15 mins,  similarly with gluten free rolls. Constant mistakes - asked for salad without any dressing I received it dressed etc.   Restaurant was not busy at all and pretty empty.
Food - bread was very nice, langoustine also lovely, light and flavours go together well. John Dory overcooked terribly with not matching sauce - absolutely coffee cocoa jus doesn't go well with it. I left almost the entire dish untouched.  Food was arriving very delayed.  Thankfully then I had a bread with butter to snack on. Definitely not what I was expecting in the slightest unfortunately. No one ever was checking up on us.  Wouldn't recommend unfortunately.",0
835,"I ate at Arzak for the first time in 1987 and have been back dozens of times since then. I have never been disappointed. The food is constant evolving, and always delicious. Do the tasting menu (you don't all have to have the same things!)",0
963,Very good and innovative food. A pricey and yet deserving experience,0
621,"The Ledbury is expensive, with food that is close to perfection, staff that are intelligent and highly experienced. It’s a class act. You go here when you want to impress and it never lets me down.",0
680,Service is great. Food is great. Ambiance is great. Best restaurant I have ever been.,0
534,"Amazing food with a clear vision. Didn't think it how the ""wow factor"" that other restaurants at this end do, and in some ways the menu felt safe, however everything was executed spectacularly. Service and wine list top notch too.",0
463,"I have just had dinner here with my young daughter. We both absolutely loved the food....honestly it was flawless, both in terms of presentation and taste....that Brown Sugar Tart....sweet Jesus ....its perfect. The front of house staff were just the best, I was truly touched at the kindness they extended to my daughter. Don't know if you guys read these reviews, tbh I don't really like writing them, but I wanted to say thank you once again, for giving us such a memorable evening........my daughter literally floated out of your restaurant on a happy, warm, fuzzy cloud. Thank you for the outstanding food, and for your thoughtful kindness.",0
1028,Beautiful creative dishes. Delicious for both the eyes and the tongue. He responds sincerely to various requests. Only the sommelier is a bit disappointing.,0
93,"This place just finish renovated 2 weeks ago the embiance better than before, also they has very good food, can't say much , must trying all of you 🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒 …",0
340,"Amazing experience!
Wait staff operate like clockwork, just impressive to sit and watch them work. But they're also super friendly to talk to.
Place has a formal yet modern vibe to it, and this is reflected also in the food.
Great flavours, great ingredients, great drinks.
Make sure you visit the bathroom during yoir sitting, to see the mushroom fridge!",1
174,Excellent lunch. Great presentation and service. Sommelier gave us some unusual yet complementary wines.,0
1006,"Comparable to Michelin one-star restaurants (Montia and Yugo), and nothing comparable to 3-star restaurants like Aponiente. The menu is acceptable, however, it does not surprise in flavors or textures or creativity. It is easy to make a good dish with a good product. If you put it at half price, it would still be excessive.",0
479,London has a lot of good restaurants and this is one of the greatest.  Everything is so refined and well done but not pretentious or precious.  Exceptional service with great guidance through the seasonal menu.  A deep and varied wine list as one would expect but it features great bottles at entry as well as top level.  Everyone how loves eating must eat here once.,0
361,"The venue is in a quiet residential area of Notting Hill.
Excellent ingredients cooked with excellent technique.
Services are good.",0
215,"Perfect cooking, flavour and service. Super friendly team, value is off the charts. You could quite easily spend the same on lunch at a run of the mill casual dining chain.

Special mention for the bread. The bread is so good, if they let me, I would visit just for bread and a whisky!

Merci,

Allez les Bleus!",0
68,"The bread was good :)
Without it we would have stayed hungry.
Very small portions, kind of tastings, which can not be said about their prices.
Some of the tastings were really good, the rest were mediocre.",0
879,A good dining experience with my friends in Arzak. Impressive quality and work for the Degustation Menu. Not a 5/5 for 2 reasons : service a bit messy for food and wines (poor explanations) & the pairing really too expensive for the wine …,0
548,I brought my wife here last week and our experience was really great. The Ledbury has great and tasty selection of foods that is worth every penny spent. Great! Your deserve to have a 5-star or  more!,0
733,Quite good food 4.75 stars out of 5 posh but not too posh,0
900,"We hit up a San Pelligrino list restaurant, or sometimes a couple, every year for our anniversary. We went to Spain this year primarily to go to Tickets. That's a great experience in and of itself but I'll stick to Arzak.

We made the trip to San Sebastian and Arzak almost as an afterthrought. It was great. In fact, it was my wife's favorite meal of all time and not the many world class restaurants we've hit up over the years. The service was good, if not exceptional. The restaurant environment and ambiance has a good vibe. The wine selection was okay; the glasses are limited. The food however was the key. The presentation was excellent and there was not an ""eh"" or bad serving on the tasting menu. The whole experience was delicious. Highly recommend.",0
110,"What a place to eat!
The service was amazing with attentive and knowledgeable staff and they make you feel welcome and treasured.
The food is to just die for!  I’ve eaten many amazing meals but this is just spectacular… everything is a taste experience of such amazing ingredients that just work and the presentation of the food is sublime.
My favourite dishes were the signature dish of sea bass and caviar and the Scottish langoustine.
The cleverest dishes were the tiny tarts of turbot and pumpkin tarts as well as the cheese course. This was a cheese mousse with fig purée and a tiny, thin cracker on top just perfect. The wine pairing was needed to make this extra special and it was our anniversary and they brought out a special finishing touch . A perfect evening and worth every penny for such an incredible dining experience… thank you",1
852,Best restaurant I've ever been. No wonder it is one of the best restaurants in the world. Pricey but worth the experience. Lots of flavors that come together like a symphony. Extensive wine list very reasonably priced.,0
341,"This restaurant definitely lives up to its fame - a Michelin two starred. Upon entry, you’d already be attracted by its fancy decorations and elegant ambience. Every dish served was a piece of artwork carefully cooked and presented. Though some of the taste were not my cup of tea. There were some in the Christmas set which I was truly in love with, such as the lobster soup(served cold), cod, and the lamb shoulder. Some food is best to be served cold so you can taste the most flavor out of it - perfectly demonstrated by the lobster soup. The cod was the finest cod I’ve had in London, very tender which made a great combination with the sauce. However, surprise never stopped in the Ledbury, the milk-fed lamb shoulder was super tender and flavorsome. I really hope that they had more of it on my plate(there was also lamb legs which was also tender but not as good as the shoulder). The Christmas tart was a nice combination of ginger and cinnamon, a good seasonal treat for the end of a nice Christmas meal. If you were to try the normal set, the brown sugar tart is a must try!!!
PS. One of my friend really appreciated their bread, and the restaurant gave us a whole loaf to take home for free!!! This pushed my expectation of ‘service’ to a whole new level. Well done!!!",1
999,"I have eaten the tasting menu and the truth is that I was disappointed because it wasn't bad because it wasn't. If not, because if you go to a 3 star restaurant for a 250 euro menu, I think you have to go out trying different flavors and the only thing really different was the fish of the day and the fish was not the size of your little toe in 3 parts. I have been to others like stretxo and I still remember each dish. Of course, the treatment was very exclusive and they were very attentive to us at all times and in the end they told us if we wanted to repeat any dish.",0
289,"We had a truly wonderful evening the food was superb excellent service
I highly recommend this restaurant",0
202,"A very interesting meal with tasty food! Unusual flavour combinations and definitely one for a special occasion. One course was cold and had to be sent back without anything being removed from the bill - which was a bit surprising. We were also given a wrong dessert but they’d provided an extra one as an apology for cold food (although they did this to all tables) and so it wasn’t an issue. But just a few problems that you wouldn’t expect from a 2* restaurant. We’d go back though, hopefully it was just a one off bad day.",0
19,"I’ve never spent so much money to feel hungry.

The view is great, the service is great, and the presentation is fantastic. The bread, handmade butter, and desert, were fantastic.

But beyond that there was a lot more show in this place than substance. 3 of the 5 courses were not tasty to me. I left feeling hungry.

Paying this much for a meal was a significant splurge for us, far beyond what we’ve ever paid, and the food was not far beyond what we’ve ever experienced.",0
177,"Had the three course lunch menu here - i thought the food was incredibly flavourful and well-balanced. From the starter to the main to the dessert, everything was perfect. Thank you!",0
717,Quite simply put - If you are after an outstanding dining experience there is no better place to visit,0
497,Amazing food! Every single dish was excellent in taste and presentation. Service is extremely friendly. Well deserved 2 michelin stars. Will definitely go back.,0
823,Whether you have the tasting menu or “a la carté” you’ll find yourself surrounded by magical flavors and tasting experiences you’ll never forget. An experience not to forget.,0
658,"friendly, easy-going staff, a relaxed atmosphere, and AMAZING food. seriously some of, if not THE, best food i've ever eaten",0
552,"If you were to only have one meal out for a whole year - this would be the place to go.

Save up for the tasting menu with matching wines.

The service balances aloof with attentive - which we loved.",0
960,An amazing experience! I have no words for this amazing restaurant,0
296,"Amazing food, fantastic service in a relaxed atmosphere. Loved it 🙂 …",0
10,"Excellent experience! Every course was an explosion of flavors. The service was beyond excellent. Best views of the city.
A birthday dinner we won’t ever forget!",0
833,"this is my favorite three star restaurant. the food is amazing and with a 4 person party you could try one of every option. although, I think everyone who chose the hake instead of the shrimp regretted not getting the shrimp. this is the best cooked shrimp we've ever had. the head is perfectly cooked so you can get the sweetness from the shrimp ""butter"" and the rest of the shrimp is great as well. the hake is amazing too but you need to give up the shrimp to get it. we tried everything except the foie for the main red meat course and the restaurant's rankings of the options matched our table's rankings ( i.e. get the pigeon).

the service here is flawless and accommodating. we've been to 3 stars all over the world and this wait staff is the only one that balances genuine care with great execution.

they are also really kind to child diners here. they provide a la carte options for younger diners and included them in the amuse and after meal chocolate so they wouldn't feel left out.",0
260,"A great front of house team and marvellous team in the Kitchen. Beautifully balanced dishes and the Risotto was superb and my wife normally bans me from eating Risotto out, as I am often disappointed. Glad I decided to risk it😊. Will return. …",0
962,One of the best culinary experiences I have had !,0
763,"Carve out 3+ hours for your lunch. It is a  Michelin three star dining experience. There is only a tasting menu, which is excellent. Some of the highlights, after service, which was fantastic; a brined tartare fish (mackerel) w Jerusalem artichokes , the pigeon, along with monk fish, and the hors d' oeuvres, were thoughtful and a blend of simplicity and complexity. The staff is kind enough to give you a quick directive on each dish, Deserts were light, and true art, but we are partial to salt. You will need a reservation, and know there is only tasting menu, which with out wine pairing is 240€, I believe the wine pairing was 430€, took us a bit by surprise for lunch. They are a fair amount of casually dressed tourists, no stress on attire.",0
262,"I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. We took our Christmas dinner here and their Christmas menu was awful. My girl said that the only good thing was their bread~~Service is ok, except that the waiter admitted that he forgot the recipe. They love cheese so much that they give you bread and said in case you feel too creamy haha",0
179,I went for lunch with the family. The three course meal was £42 but worth it. Very beautifully presented dishes into which a lot of thought has gone. Excellent service and ambience.,0
930,"Arzak has lived in my imagination for years. To have now eaten the food created by a man that was like a father to Anthony Bourdain, one of my heroes, is an experience I won't soon forget. Elena's creativity is a revelation and truly life-affirming. I feel incredibly lucky to have eaten here. World class cuisine is an understatement.",1
251,My first time at a michelin star restaurant and I'm happy!,0
687,Excellent! Celebrated our wedding anniversary there and everything was fantastic! Certainly recommend it!,0
387,"Excellent service & the most tender beef I have had maybe ever. Delicious amuse bouses . Honestly , I am not writing much because my experience at the Ledbury was simply so good , I think it is superfluous to write so much . Come and experience it for yourself . Truly lives up to its 2 Michellin stars . I am so happy I came here for dinner on my last night in London.",0
875,"Exceed all expectations. Our server suggested subbing out certain dishes for others on the tasting menu to get a more expansive experience, which was very nice. Extra bonus.. Elena came out to chat with each table towards the end of the night!",1
272,"La Dame De Pic London is outstanding.  Having visited the Parisian restaurant I decided to try the new London base. I was hoping it would be a different concept to Paris and it was. Outstanding food, amazing innovations and great service. Enjoy!",0

652,"""This was our second visit, service was above and beyond what we would normally expect.. Food was amazing. Cannot fault it and will be returning again soon.",0
968,To say this was an experience of a lifetime would be an understatement.  I have never experienced anything like it .,0
1016,"A luxury restaurant, the decoration and the sober but at the same time intimate place. For me, the best thing was the treatment of the staff, informing us at all times of the content of the culinary delights that were served to us at all times. The food is very elaborate with a multitude of nuances. At first you think you will be hungry but it is difficult to finish all the chef's proposals. Congratulations to the Arzaks and all the members of this magnificent restaurant.",0

Food - very good, fresh ingredients, unique flavor combinations, exceptional presentation, some dishes were too interesting for me, would highly recommend beef, lamb and Mille-feuille

1007,A prestigious restaurant that has been around for many years and is an institution in its food.,0
54,"This restaurant gives you a high-end quality for a very reasonable price. Probably one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The staff was so pleasant, and so engaging. The food was excellent, each course was well laid out. We had a 8 course meal for about 250 each. Could not have asked for a better meal. And if you're lucky enough to get a table near the window you have an excellent view of Amsterdam. Well done chef!",0

22,"Very nice restaurant of French cuisine with Japanese touch with a great view on Amsterdam. While reservation we mentioned that it was my boyfriend’s dad 70th Birthday night out, but unfortunately we didn’t even get table near the window with a great view. The food was really great all the bites and seafood dishes were amazing, bread with different types of butter is excellent. Duck was good, but nothing mind blowing, wagyu was good, but unfortunately not a ribeye or sirloin cut. Pre-dessert was great, great idea of presentation of freshly made nougat. Desert was refreshing, but nothing special. Good experience, very nice and friendly staff, but didn’t live up to our expectations!",0
351,"Cannot fault this restaurant at all. The service, the food, everything is on point. The staff are nice and very chatty which is nice and it’s not too stuffy that you don’t feel comfortable which I find with a lot of fine dining restaurants in UK. Not having a dress code yet the atmosphere is warm and very cosy. The presentation of food is what is expected of a fine dining restaurant, the taste is great. Loved executed dish expect for Deer. But it could be that I was already too full by the time I got there and I personally am not a fan of anything too Gamey in taste. The restaurant catered for my partners onion and garlic minor allergy by excluding it in his meal which is very nice as it’s sometimes quite hard to cater for that. Overall a very nice restaurant & would def go back when the menu is updated as it’s a degustation only so not much to choose from really but they do cater if there is a dish you don’t like and more than happy to swap it out.",1
366,"Worth your hard earned money! Service is impeccable! The food, well the experience is memorable and the dishes are flawless. There is no music in the background and it's an airy feel where every seat is good. Very much recommended.",0
925,I was never a Michelin expert but the food here was amazing and presentation was incredible.  I would rank it one if the best tasting menus I've ever had.,0
918,"Arzak did not meet my expectations; although the food was good (especially the lamb and the pigeon) it was not very special / innovative, no wow factor. The St Pellegrino website said the restaurant had a great view but there was no view.

Although the restaurant has been in the Arzak family for ages, it did not feel as a family restaurant and the interior of the restaurant was very modern and rather cold.

One dish was served on an extremely old Philips tablet which was a bit odd and did not add to the experience.

The staff was nice however their English language skills were rather limited which probably added to our (lack of) experience.

Many other restaurants in the area which I would check out before going to Arzak.",0
904,"I got a trip to this 3 star Michelin resuturant as a gift and I have to say this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The food was amazing, the service was amazing. We even got a visit frol the chef herself. An experience I will thresher forever.",1

345,"Best restaurant I've ever been to - we had a marvelous 8 course tasting menu and it was phenomenal from the service, to the flavors, and the ambiance.

We especially liked the lamb & mutton dish with a crispy potato roll and stuffed morel as well as the desserts of the mango millefeuille and kefir lime meringue, amazing.

Compared to CORE by Clare (the other tasting menu we had on our London trip) I thought Ledbury was better value and the dishes were better.",0

211,"The most amazing and innovative food I have ever eaten.  Great attention to detail led to superb presentation and flavours.

The sommellier that matched the wines to our courses was astounding. Knowledgeable and thoughtful in his choices.

Being coeliac makes dining out problematic but I knew with absolute confidence I would not need to worry. The friend we dined with has an intolerance to garlic and her needs were met in the same attentive way.

Dishes were adapted to suit my need but with no compromise on taste or presentation.",0

886,"I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said, but this is a very special place, worth a pilgrimage. Service is stellar, wine selection is brilliant, and the food is mind-blowing. Unlike some Avant Guard restaurants, the experimentation has been conducted behind the scenes, in advance, and not on the patrons.",0

Creative menu, friendly and professional staff.",0
58,"Overpriced , but yeah okay you pay for the experience eating in a 2* Michellin restaurant in Okura hotel in Amsterdam.. I enjoyed the Wyagu beef, the wine arrangement (not all were my favourite) and the selection of butter. This really filled my stomach so we skipped the cheese selection in the end. We got a second dessert and after a lot of chocolate bonbons (sugar overload, way too much).The tea experience was a bit a dissapointment, next too the hot water too much cold water was poured by the waitress. Overall it was a nice experience but not sure if I would recommend it.",0

1019,"It's amazing that the person who answers the phone in such a restaurant in the Basque Country does not know Basque.
It's amazing that in a Basque restaurant of that size I couldn't understand Basque on the phone.",0
847,"Food is great but the service is not. Especially for a 3 star Michelin I expected more. Vegetarian food seems like an afterthought as well. Would not come back, especially considering the great amount of Michelin stars in this city",0
574,"Out of any doubt one of the best restaurants in London for an overall experience.
Hidden on the heart of Notting Hill this restaurant fusion the classic attention to detail with one of the most exciting menus in the city.
The best place for a big celebration.",0
785,"Exceptional meal with professional, attentive, unobtrusive service. They were able to accommodate us at the last minute only due to a cancellation. If you want to eat here, reservations are required. In addition to the last minute availability, they put together a vegan tasting menu on the fly for Jacqueline. The care and appreciation for food quality and a delightful experience is obvious in everything.",0

829,"One of the pillars of Basque haute cuisine in San Sebastian, need to reserve early to secure a table. Chef Elena Arzak cooks refined and tasty dishes, and comes to greet customers in person. The deserts were fabulous. Excellent wine list and service. Unfortunately a little bit cramped since the restaurant is still in its historic location where it started more than a century ago.",1
63,"Truly lives upto its michelin stars. It's one of the best places in Amsterdam for a great dinner, amazing service and beautiful view of the city. The caviar is one of the specials of the place - make sure you try it out whilst there.
There was so much of good stuff here - it's difficult to break it down. All I can say is that we spent 5 hours for our dinner and it was special in every which way - food, service, ambience and view.",0
923,"Unless you are close to being penniless, and even then find some way, do not even contemplate spending time in Donostia-San Sebastián without going to Arzak. This restaurant is, in so many ways, what a good restaurant should be and deliver. It does deliver!

Sometimes when you have high expectations and, why wouldn’t you, because Elena Arzak has presently been voted the top female chef in the world. After lunching there several weeks ago it did not come at all as a surprise. From the time, we stepped in the front door to the time we were escorted out of the front door the service; the food, the staff, the ambience, the décor and the experience were faultless. The restaurant is presently undergoing renovation on the outside so it was a little unprepossessing when we arrived. However, as soon as we stepped inside all of that was swept away.
We were fortunate enough to have Elena come out and take us for a tour of the kitchen. It was a reliable indication in its calm orderly and efficient atmosphere of the gastronomic experience to follow. I think that was prompted by my wife having been to one of her master classes in Melbourne. The world is a small place. Elena had purchased one of her favourite dresses from Lisa Gorman in Melbourne. Lisa lives 100 meters down the street from us. However, back to the experience.

After being seated in the restaurant, Elena was gracious enough to make some suggestions and variations on her degustation menu. I have attached a copy of that menu, and frankly, I would have been happy to eat anything from it. As my wife does not drink red wine we generally compromise on Rosé. Arzak have their in-house Rosé, which is delightfully dry and crisp. It was a more than a satisfactory match for the food. Sometimes life is a compromise, for that matter, so is marriage.
Elena is married to an architect who has overseen a wonderfully understated renovation of the restaurant. The wait staff was attentive and professional without being obsequious. They were pleased to explain the dishes, which came at a perfect pace.

We were fortunate to meet Elena’s father who started this restaurant and who still greets the customers at each table. Elena herself is articulate, extremely friendly and quietly in complete control of her establishment.
I am thrilled we went for lunch, not because I think the evening meal or experience would be any less, but simply it did give me the chance to digest one of the best meals I have ever tasted and to have time to think about it before going to bed on a full stomach. Seriously, do not leave town without going to Arzak.",1
263,"Brilliant would be an understatement. Sheer bliss, great food, good wine list & excellent staff who explained in detail everything you were going to eat. One minor fault, lighting at table poor, aggravated by the small typeface on menu, torch from mobile phone used.",0
708,"Tasting menu, wine list - incredible. Probably worth more than 2 stars.",0
59,"Mind blowing culinary experience! Each dish here is a piece of art. Service, wine pairing, drinks and the view: all wonderful.  It is quite pricy but worth for an extraordinary experience. Michellin 2 star is very well deserved.",0
819,"Nice building. Although it is a fine dining restaurant, it gave me the feeling of a family restaurant. The staff were really nice.",0
325,"What a delightful experience. We went for dinner and we really enjoyed every minute. The staff are very attentive and super welcoming and friendly. Every dish served was a pleasant experience, although I would have preferred larger portions to enjoy the taste longer 😂 The dishes are served over 3 hours. Overall we really enjoyed it for a special occasion, as the food served is quite unique to the restaurant, they are not common dishes that you can find at other restaurants. Overall, you pay for the experience (£250 pp).",0
821,"Food that is quite amazing and high quality, a lovely restaurant and friendly serving staff. Highly recommended!",0
373,Celebrated my fiancés 30th birthday here with the 8 course tasting menu with wine package. Recommended highly. Food was incredible and wine pairs immensely well.,0
111,"Entering the restaurant was extremely grand. Service staff were extremely polite and attentive.

We selected the voyager tasting experience and were dissatisfied with the meal.

Execution and balance of the tasting menu was extremely disappointing. All the dishes were quite full flavoured and over powering …. it was too much on the palette. High recommend for slot in some lighter dishes to provide the palette a break ;-) Chef did use amazing ingredients were top notch and super fresh.

Scallop was best executed but over salted. Butter was just too experimental for me.

It’s a real shame ;-) don’t think we will be back again.",0
134,"An absolutely remarkable place to enjoy a true dining experience. The menu is particularly well designed on the drinking side which is often left to be ""wine only"". We went for a 6 course meal as a couple and were stunned by the journey. The service was also 5 stars!",0
485,"Update 25.09.17:

It has been few years since I have been to the Ledbury and I have to say it is still top. The food I feel is even better than on my last visit and the service as attentive as always.

This restaurant is one of the top restaurants in the world for a reason! Anybody who is lucky to get a table should definitely come and try it out for yourself you will not regret it (well not at least until you get the bill ^^)

Ps: and if you do get a chance try to say hello to the kitchen team and chef graham they deserve a big thank you too!

Old review 2015:

Booked for my birthday and it was the first time I ever visited a 2 star michelin star restaurant.

I have to say I do really enjoyed the whole experience. The service was definitely one of the best I have ever experienced. The presentation of the food was also very nice.

We had the tasting menu and the lamb was probably the best I ever had in my life.

The only nick picking would be that a fruit fly landed into my wine glass but a staff member was helpful enough to fish it out for me.

For sure a restaurant worth visiting and recommending.

Cheers!",0
581,"World class tasting menu with excellent service.
Try to meet chef graham and his team if you are lucky and got a table here. This restaurant deserves to be in the top 50 restaurants on the planet",0
517,"The most amazing lunch I've ever had. The service is phenomenal, the attention to detail is by far the best I have seen. Lunch menu is accessible and not too expensive. The dishes were amazing. Highly recommended !",0
784,Amazing place if you want to know why San Sebastian is one of the world's food capitals. Each dish was extremely well thought through and tasted great. Service was a bit harsh but this is Spain after all. Had some great wines and a truly tremendous time.,0
478,Really good food. Nice atmosphere - not too stuffy or pretentious. Staff were excellent. Very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu.,0
885,"This restaurant is over-rated  , bread was cold & not properly presented .
Food was so so & i really can’t accept that slow cook onzen egg was over-cooked for a famous 3 michelin star restaurant. Ingredients are not special . Really not worth to try . Many restaurants in San Sabastian can do much better .",0
545,"Okay so straight up I was pouting about going here - last time I stepped foot through these doors I was 10 years ago - i was midway through a bad relationship and all we focused on was espresso martinis ( they were incredible here btw ) and staying up until 5am...

a larger than life bill with dinner untouched and a half cut girlfriend meant that my experience here before was dreadful, almost as bad as my hangover the next day!

Now, a little older... maybe not wiser - as soon as we were seated... bang. My smile really did turn upside down. We dined as a four and sat near the corner - service was incredible, it’s like the waiter could hear my thoughts...! The wine was excellent and dinner slipped down easily... the bill was expensive, even for the area - but well worth it.",0
210,"Firstly,  the service was brilliant! Professional,  friendly staff.  However, apart from the steak tartare, the food was confusing on the palette and unbalanced.  Very strange for a 2 Michelin star restaurant.  There is a fine line between experimenting and good flavour combinations which was comprised on this occasion. All of us around the table agreed that the beautiful looking plates,  with clearly good cooking techniques just tasted strange verging on unpleasant. Thank you to the staff though for making the overall experience positively memorable. Watch out,  I might steal your team for my next venture! 😀",0
348,"As good a meal as i've eaten in a long long time. The price point is high so only for those very special occasions but it delivered a memorable and truly delicious experience on our visit. The staff could not have been more charming, informative and considerate whilst the sommelier picked some great wine pairings for our meal. The high end modern European dining scene can be accused of pretentiousness and overdone formality but the atmosphere here was warm and inviting. For those who like modern European food this will surely delight and amaze.",0
459,"One of our best dining experiences. The service was spot on and every course of the tasting menu was delicious, innovative and absolutely beautiful. The wine pairings worked perfectly. This restaurant deserves all the praise it receives and more.",0
21,This was an unforgettable experience! Still remember the chick and the taste! Very nice!,0

745,"This is, hands down, the best culinary experience I've ever had. The service, knowledge of staff, and ambiance were impressive. The tasting menu was out of this world.",0
30,"Amazing food, really in a special way prepared.  The waiters know so much about all the wines and dishes and they  just tell you in such a nice way...loved it! Worth every cent.",0
532,"Not one dish was actually good. They were pretty but all too buttery/fat/rich without any kind of the subtlety the chef used to have.
Shame",0

836,Wonderful experience! We visit San Sebastian for two days and this restaurant was worth it. Fine dining with 10 stars,0
750,A ⭐️⭐️⭐️ experience! Our expectations were high but they were met in all aspects.  The food wine pairings were perfect! I very much loved the sweet txakoli wine with the apple dessert.  This place was well worth making a reservation 3 months in advance!,0
584,One of the best vegan tasting menu + wine pairing!! I couldn't recommend it more!!,0
591,"Given its reputation, The Ledbury is relaxed and unpretentious. The food is oustanding and the wine not as expensive as you might think. The service too is brilliant and friendly. Expensive but worth it.",0

234,Quite outstanding in almost every way. Wonderful food really beautifully presented. Sometimes I felt it was almost a shame to eat what was on my plate but when I did it was even more of a superb experience. The roast quail was excellent. Small well chosen menu. Very good service. Not cheap but you won't forget the meal or the experience.,0

83,"Best gastronomical moment of my life, great staff, perfection was in every dish, worth every penny. Thanks so much to everyone, it was magical.",0
139,"The food here was excellent and beautifully presented as it should be, even for a set lunch menu. The wagyu tartare was a little lost as having a cold sorbet on top killed any flavour you could get from the meat. Whilst I wasn't convinced by the mille feuille, it was definitely a dessert that stood out above the  pear alternative (and though delightful, not worth the full £19 price tag!) What lost them my rating was the fact at lunch when people are usually on schedules, it took asking three times before we got our order taken. Not because they were rushing to do something else, but because ""a manager"" has to take it. Service standard overkill, it irritates people more to ask three times than to get someone who can't explain the menu fully (which we didn't need), common sense issue really. We also saw someone's desserts sitting on the side deflating for at least eight minutes before being served, and the gap between our main and dessert was also extensive despite saying we didn't need a gap. I'd still recommend this place, ignore the ""service"" though the staff were pleasant enough, the food was excellent at lunch time costs but for the type of restaurant this is, everything should be seamless.",0
455,"Went here with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. We could not have left this place being happier.

We chose the 7 course taster menu, every single meal was delicious and had a lovely design to it. The waiter we had was very nice and helpful. he explained every dish to us and made our entire experience pleasant.

the customer service at this place is one of the best and i would highly recommend this restaurant.",0

460,"My experience at ""The Ledbury"" was beyond compare.
The staff was very attentive and professional,and the food was simply ecstatic.
I went fro the tasting menu with wines,and i was not disappointed.
everything was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned...and with certainty the cornish cod on the tasting menu was the best dish i ever had in my life.
Never before had such ecstatic food and such great service all in one night.
I am really rooting for their 3rd star",0

890,We had a great and happy dinner at Arzak! The food is solid and we can see lots of effort are put into each course. The service is great and very welcoming. We got the chance to talk to chef Elena and she is very kind. We liked almost every course. It's a top recommendation in this city for high dining lovers.,1

990,"We had a tasting menu and were not disappointed. From the starter appetizer to the desserts, all the dishes are delicious, original and surprising, at least for me. Well explained. The different and beautiful tableware. The unbeatable attention. All staff attentive.

767,"Better late than never, I celebrated my birthday on Oct 29, 2021 during the peak of Covid-19 at this fine establishment. Arzak is a true culinary masterpiece, a gastronomic journey that goes beyond borders and pleases the senses. Located in the heart of San Sebastián, this restaurant run by the talented Chef Elena Arzak and awarded three Michelin stars will take you on a journey through the art of Basque cuisine. The excellent service and perfectly matched wine enhance
the dining experience. My birthday celebration at Arzak was the highlight of this unforgettable journey.",1

146,"Beautifully presented food with very delicate flavours. Great service and very friendly staff . Amazing value for lunch.
For a Michelin star restaurant , it would have been normal for them to present an Amuse Bouche and a wider variety of petite fours which was lacking here.
Nevertheless, it was a great experience and highly recommend it",0

580,"To preface my review, this is concerning a dinner I had at the Ledbury in April 2015 so it's somewhat possible that things may have improved. My partner and I booked a late dinner for two (9:45) and were looking forward to trying out a two star michelin restaurant. We have been to many higher end restautants in London and...",0

1005,"The best cuisine in the world, the tastiest and most original dishes that can be tasted. The decoration is very cozy and all the people who work there make you feel welcome in their home, thanks to them the experience becomes sublime and perfect.",0
778,"This was a lovely experience. Regardless of the Micheline stars and history, it was a very relaxing and casual dinner. Three of us had the tasting menu without the wine paring and it was fine to consult on wine with the sommelier on two good bottles of basque Txakoli wine to start and an excellent bottle of red to end. The presentation was simple and lovely and the favors were astoundingly good. We opted for different options each for the mains and shared them with great results if you are up for that. The price is also stunning: $954 for three people with 2 bottles of wine. But still, this was a pilgrimage for us and part of the whole reason to be in San Sebastian in the first place.",0
939,"3 Michelin star, the Bocuse of Spain.  Building, food philosophy and dishes and plating reflects a different era. literally the most famous restaurant in San Sebastian.",0
516,"Oh, Ledbury, your divineness knows no bounds! What more can I possibly add to the previous reviews singing your praises? One reviewer perfectly described the food as 'rightness.' All the flavours are fresh and unique and it's just fun to eat- the mackerel is superb. Perhaps the only thing I can add to all the other reviews is to praise the service. One of the managers was also American and spent a good deal of time talking to us about the menu (he knew EVERYTHING!), the restaurant's and chef's backgrounds, and just about restaurants in general and comparing the American and British food scenes. He was really friendly without being overbearing and seemed to genuinely love his work and want to make it an enjoyable evening for us. The staff literally anticipated everything and knew what we wanted before we did, which made the whole experience totally relaxing and you never had to worry about something going awry. These are clearly professionals. If I won the lottery tomorrow, the first thing I would do is go eat at the Ledbury. Actually, even if I don't win the lottery I will go back and eat at the Ledbury- it's worth it.",1
762,"Excellent meal; the food was delicious and very cool/inventive, fantastic presentation. The service was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself could use an update; the setup is a bit strange and the decor a bit dated, but it’s fine. A wonderful experience overall.",0
752,"There is quite simply nothing that compares to Arzak. We have been blessed to experience multiple Michelin Three Star restaurants and all are wonderful culinary symphonies. What elevates Arzak is the art of hospitality. There is no pretentiousness, no judgment of the guest. If there is something you don’t prefer on the tasting menu, the service team effortlessly comes up with a different plan and verifies that it will work for you.

Chef Elena makes multiple passes through the dining room, meaningfully engaging with her guests and even referencing previous talking points. I have never witnessed this behavior at an establishment of this caliber.

The team has passion for their craft, loves their guests and are led with inspiration. Guess what. You taste it in the food…it has soul.

Cesar served us years ago when a relative of a colleague booked a reservation, and we had done no research to know what we were getting into. When we told him we couldn’t handle a full tasting menu, he crafted something that gave us the essence of the Arzak experience and it was exquisite. Cesar arranged a tour of the kitchen and even took a photo with me. I never forgot Cesar’s hospitality.

Imagine my surprise last week when Cesar began reviewing the tasting menu with the table next to us! The night ended with a long conversation about how Cesar had found his way to Arzak and the special brand of hospitality that can be found there.

If you have to choose one meal, this is it.",1
483,"Incredible dining experience in a friendly environment. One of the best restaurants in the world, definitely my favourite in London, the dishes are full of surprises and are exceptionally crafted. What makes this place stand out is also the quality and friendliness of the service that you don't find anywhere else. Also note that service included in the prices.",0
755,The food is as great as advertised. Every course exceeded our expectations. Great service and very friendly. Elena even visited our table twice. I didn’t know that I needed fried garlic soup or corn ice cream in my life until today. Ignore the negative reviews and trust the experts at Michelin,1
9,"Located on the 23rd floor of the Okura Hotel (where we were staying) Ciel Bleu is a rather classic but nonetheless amazing fine dining restaurant with a beautiful view on Amsterdam. I found the ambience definitely less formal then expected (positive not for me) mostly because of the great job of the waiters.
We opted for the season menu with the modern wine pairing and were definitely satisfied with the quality and quantity of what we had. Everything is balanced, perfectly executed and made with the finest ingredients.
As a little extra you can end the night in the lounge, absolutely recommended.",0
363,"Delicious fine dining restaurant in the heart of Notting Hill. Superb modern British cuisine combining seasonal ingredients and beautiful flavours. Service in impeccable, and the full experience is just great. Really recommend going for the tasting menu - make sure to be hungry, as there's a lot of food, and give yourself a lot of time!",0

Food was intricate, colourful, delicious, perfectly plated, and paired with the perfect wine.

Absolutely worth every penny.",0
837,"Amazing Food experience but 10-12 menu courses was bit too much for us as we are small eater, Excellent quality Stars Restaurant.
She is a very nice friendly Lady and give us some tips where to go for excellent Pinxtos in Old City Center.

It would great if the Table setting not next to each other. We had 2 Russian Lady next to our Table and they were very Loud.

It needs space and tranquil Atmosphere. We didn’t feel romantic to celebrate our Love here.

It was difficult for us to enjoy the Experience being there and we paid a Fortune for this, flowing direct from Amsterdam to Bilbao then to San Sebastián by car.

Maybe we will try it again next time but also not sure.",0

252,"One thing can be said about today's extended  lunch here, not only fine dining, but also fun dining. Lovely space, with 5m tall ceilings, airy with almost casual, yet beautiful air. The welcome and the service I received from personable and affable restaurant manager Nicolas Bierry, and his  staff, including Alvin, was much appreciated. The sous chef Giacomo Tranquili made his head chef proud by getting to my table a perfectly cooked quail, which first comes out in a smoking cast iron dish, and then is beautifully served with, again, a perfectly cooked piece of foie gras. Scottish langostines were good, desserts I don't really get excited about, even here, though the tea selection was a nice touch (go with Alvin's recommendation!). Fab experience I would like to repeat before too long.",1
989,"I know her daughter from the times I have been here, but not her famous father, but I can say about her that she was treated unbeatably and with a lot of education.

In this restaurant I don't order from the menu, nor from the typical tasting menu, but what I do is always take advice because they are usually right and completely right.

The day of the Tamborrada El Maestro is truly a spectacle and really animates the party. It is a shame that it is extremely difficult to reserve that day since the diners on that day come back practically all of them, absolutely every year.

The treatment by the staff is unbeatable, not a gentleman's treatment, it is a friendly approach that is greatly appreciated.

I highlight the quality of the products they use in all their dishes, although there are dishes that I don't like, it's not because of them, it's just because there are some things that I don't like, but the people I've been to tell me they are incredible.

I love that mix of traditional Basque with touches of modernity that they experience every year. What I do see as very positive is that year after year they want to improve and they do not stagnate or rest on their laurels.

I have to highlight a great selection of wines that they have.",0

882,"I came with such expectations for the legendary restaurant. Sadly they’re trapped in the past. Would never receive three stars today, and some of the sloppiness makes me even question if they’d receive one (creased menus?!). Lovely staff, but need to try harder.",0
336,"Had an absolutely fantastic lunch here just before Christmas. Service is awesome; friendly, helpful and unassuming. The food was fabulous; innovative, creative, excellent quality and great flavours. Highly recommended. Go now before they get their Michelin stars back!",0
864,"The food was delightful but we suffered terrible food poisoning from the lunch. All 8 of us had the tasting menu & everyone either threw up or had diarrhea after that. It was so bad that my daughter nearly fainted and had to be hospitalized. It spoilt our entire holiday as we only recovered from the ordeal 3-4 later. Arzak refused to admit that it was their fault and was defensive and claimed that we were the only ones that suffered the food poisoning. We have been to so many Michelin star restaurants around the world and this is the first time we have ever suffered gastroenteritis from a Michelin starred  restaurant. Thanks to Arzak, San Sebastián will be remembered as our trauma trip. They definitely have to improve their food handling!!!",0
719,"Properly posh Michelin starred fare, with prices to match if that's what you're after!",0
415,An unbelievable restaurant in every way. A little slice of heaven in Notting Hill. From the service to the dishes and drinks there is care for every detail. A truly memorable experience.,0
589,"Amazing food at the Ledbury. We went for the lunch menu, a four course meal which came with multiple amuse-bouche, a pre-desert, and petit fours, paired with delicious wines. Great food, great service, and an overall memorable experience.",0
912,"Colorful, creative and delicious.  It's inventive but  I wouldn't qualify it as entirely unique nor off the charts.  Some of the dishes were gimmicky, the tv under the glass plate, for instance.  The skateboard?  All well and good but the food has to really shine and it didn't always.  The sommelier was the reason I dropped this rating to 3.  Entirely rushed, too busy to take any time for questions about the wine and blurted out his answers while closing the wine menu to end our discussion.  Fortunately our sever recognized our disappointment in that engagement and stepped in to fill in the gaps left by his lack of service.  A surprising miss considering the Michelin 3 star rating.",0
176,"We came for a casual lunch, the service and atmosphere are standard for a fine dinning restaurant. Very disappointed with the food experience though, some dishes were overcooked and too heavy on cheese /cream in general.",0
956,From all the fine dining experiences I had in Spain this one stood out for the superb food and warmth in service.,0
220,"Artistic and delicious dishes, served by friendly and knowledgeable staff.",0
866,"Came here for dinner during by honeymoon trip. First time to a Michelin 3 star restaurant and it definitely did not disappoint.

Had an amazing meal and the service was excellent. We really wanted to try their tasting menu but felt it would have been too much food for us. So instead of having us order a la carte dishes they let us order customized 4 course tasting menu instead.

Although I found one of my dish (monk fish) a little too salty, they took care of me by immediately replacing it with a different dish. Elena even came out herself to check to ensure everything was OK. It was. The replacement along with everything else was delicious.

Love this restaurant. Will return.",1
277,Beautiful food. Sauces were too salty but service perfect. The original location in Valence is much better.,0
594,Best meal I've had in London. Every course of a very high standard with service being excellent. Can see why this is consistently ranked as one of the best restaurants in the world.,0
243,Impeccable service and just a wonderful experience. It was hard to choose as everything looked delicious but the legendary millefeuille is a must.,0
500,"Spent the afternoon here trying their tasting menu (6 hours in total). Service was great - professional and friendly. The restaurant manager was most accommodating when taking our order, re-adjusting the menu where required unlike some other restaurants of a similar level. The atmosphere was relaxed yet formal enough providing a high standard of service. The wine list is extensive with an Austrian selection of wines which I find rarely seen outside Austria. The dishes themselves are fantastic: both individual and combination of tastes and textures can be clearly distinguished giving some surprising combinations in tasting experience. Would definitely recommend the tasting menu which is seasonal.",0
38,"It's a good place to dine, good food, good service and good produce. It's a place to go once, but maybe that's about it. There's better offers in Amsterdan for the same price and quality.",0
130,"Overall the experience was good and the place amazing.Staff was very good,polite and attentive but unfortunately we faced some issues.We informed the staff twice for our taste preferences, I received a dish with goat cheese which I couldnt consume at all but they manage to change after I mentioned it for third time. Food stages were skipped, we had the fish course before the starter. Spent 03:00 - 3:30 hours for an 8 course menu. Sourdough with butter and cornish crab were the best.",0
102,"We have been to La Dame de Pic a few times when they had only a star and it always have been one of our favorite place to have lunch. We are back for lunch today and the cooking was beat our expectations, honestly better than the other 2 female chefs who has 3 stars in London. We had the journey menu, and it was the perfect quantity for lunch. My favorite dish was the whiskey soaked tomato and the cured sweetbread before was very innovative!
We also thought it was very nice for the restaurant to allow free corkage up to a bottle to let fine dining become more accessible to younger people",0
537,"Best restaurant in London. Incredible food; the chefs led by Brett Graham have designed each course of the tasting menu (regular and vegetarian) to be outstanding and completely different from each other. The curd of buffalo milk with truffle toast is a favourite as is the passion fruit souffle with sauternes ice cream.
The wine pairings are chosen very well by a good sommelier who really knows each wine.
Relaxed atmosphere and great service from friendly staff.
I have been there twice for the tasting menu with wine pairings and plan to return soon. I believe this should get the third star in the near future; it'll be be well deserved!",1
447,My husband and I had dinner Feb 3rd for our anniversary. A congratulations card awaited on the table when we arrived.  Gorgeous tasting menu with a number of delicious extras. Staff was friendly and unpretentious. Setting was stylish and relaxing. Looking forward to our next visit!,0

730,"Food amazing , service excellent  well worth a visit .",0
189,"Underwhelmed I think sums up my experience on a recent visit for dinner. Great surroundings and attentive and friendly staff are I hope a given at such an establishment but the food was not as notable as I had hoped. I am not a foodie but I felt the selection provided (in the club menu option) did not have the wow factor one hopes for. I also find it a bit irritating when the waiter, usually often with a strong foreign accent, announces all the ingredients of the current dish, leaving me little the wiser. I would prefer to retain the menu so I can review what I am eating as I eat it. Surely an important reason for going to an expensive restaurant is the food and understanding the tastes being offered. I have no major criticism of the restaurant (apart from being rather hidden away) but I would not recommend it even for special occasions such as ours.",0
801,"Great food. Top tip for those from the US (about >60% of your clientele, it appears) ... You may not want to brand all of your female servers with a scarlet letter “A”. It has a slightly different meaning to us who remember high school English class.",0
303,Good food and strong wine list. Would come back for drinks.,0
817,One of the best meals I've had in my life.,0

97,"A fantastic experience. The tasting menu takes you on a marvelous ride along a road full of flavor and texture. Every single plate and bite was enjoyable and memorable.
The place has a refined taste, and they take care of every tiny aspect so you get the best time. The best moment of the evening was when the chef López came to introduce himself to the table and asked us to go with him and meet the kitchen and the staff behind the curtains.
All that you could expect from a two-star Michelin Restaurant you will find it here.",1

It’s not cheap, but if you’re celebrating a special occasion or want to treat someone special, I couldn’t recommend a visit here enough.  A real
5 star experience",0
749,This was the best we've ever had!  Everything is inventive and super yummy.  The new Sommelier is awesome as is the all the staff. We went without the pairing and ordered wine separately.  This way we were able to try even more delights.,0
884,"The food is not bad but given the quality of food in San Sebastian, it's hard to consider the value of what you're getting.
We got the the tasting menu and were very glad that we could chop and change some of the dishes to others on the menu. The experience was quite pleasant with Elena coming out and having a brief chat. Asir the Maitre d was lovely and explained the restaurant, it's cuisine and ingredients very well.
Overall, save the money on the wonderful pinxtos bars instead.",1
15,"Ciel Bleu is truly one of the most outstanding restaurants I've ever had the pleasure to dine at. My partner and I had the 'Guestronomy' taster menu for my 32nd birthday this week and it certainly went down a treat.

The service was perfect, the food was perfect, the view was perfect, everything was absolutely perfect! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough and will almost certainly be back again in the future.

Special thanks to Jane and Mandy from the floor staff and chef Arjan Speelman who went to every effort to make it the great experience that it was. Many thanks in addition for the very kind signed menu!",1
1,"Diner at Ciel Bleu is a truly fantastic experience.
Located on the 23rd floor of Hotel Okura, Ciel Bleu offers an amazing dining experience, supplemented by an exceptional view over Amsterdam.

From entering the restaurant and throughout the evening, Ciel Bleu staff is there to comfort your every need. Service is exceptional, as can be expected from a restaurant operating at 2-star level for over 15 years. Timings of the dishes is aligned, wine is presented at the right time, everything is orchestrated just flawlessly.

The ambiance is comfortable, grey and white tones with thought-out lighting. Seats are very pleasant, and the way the tables and seats are arranged offers a great deal of privacy. For the view, try arranging a window seat, it is worth it.

Food is of the highest standard. Combination of flavours is complex but balanced. A few photos are attached, though they hardly do the dishes justice. All dishes are presented well, and the wine pairing lifts them to the next level. Personal highlights were the Seabass and A5 Wagyu beef, along with the chocolate dessert.

Fully recommend Ciel Bleu for an unforgettable gastronomic experience. The food, service and setting are simply top notch.",0
929,Amazing food and a very gracious host. Thank you  Elena!,1
318,"We recently visited the Ledbury for a special event. They were super organised with congratulatory messages on cards for us.
The service was great and so was the personal attention to us. I guess that’s expected as it’s a two Michelin star restaurant. As usual good wine list and loads of wines to choose from even wines by glass. As expected it’s pricey and we know whenever we visit a top Michelin restaurant the prices in central London will be quite steep ( so be prepared for that )
We had the tasting menu which was really nice and some pictures are attached to my note. You wouldn’t expect to like everything but most of the courses very delicious.
Verdict 5/5
Budget easily £250/- per person and more depending on how / which wines you choose",1
698,Simply fantastic. The food and the team are world class.,0
901,"Very creative, artful, colorful, rich in substance. The staff is welcoming, friendly, working like bees to satisfy all tables. The menu de dégustation is smart and flexible as one can choose, and the quantity leaves a person satisfied, not over stuffed, a wide selection of wine is good.",0
663,I love the food and the atmosphere was really comfortable. Amazing place to grab your dinner,0

We had a brilliant evening at this restaurant, Ledbury. Food was awesome and the service was dramatically friendly and of course professional... everything was much more than we expected.
We cannot wait to go back for another special experience.",0

212,"Just wonderful. Food is an utter delight, full of surprises. The room ( and hotel)  is just beautiful, and the staff are so professional, but fun.  The moment you leave your dining chair masks must be on, if you forget, you will be reminded instantly and offered a disposable one if necessary - politely but firmly, you feel safe. They had only been open two days when we went, but the entire staff are engaging and warm. We were admiring the stunning photo series of Karl Lagerfeld and immediately offered a tour telling us about each one. They are part of a very exciting Afternoon Themed Tea which will be really fun. It was expensive, but good value,  a really fabulous afternoon.",1
180,"Excellent in every single way. The menu, the surroundings, the environment, the service. Everything is simply perfect.",0
112,"A true fine dining experience in a stunning venue

Within the Four Season Trinity's landmark hotel, the restaurant is modern and fairly relaxed.

My girlfriend and I went for the lengthiest of the two tasting menus which was composed of 9 different dishes. The experience starts with some amuse-bouches and goes through different vegetarian, fish and meat dishes. The flavours and techniques used are combining French, Italian and Asian inspiration, making you discover new tastes and enjoyable combinations which made this dinner a real culinary experience.

As in many modern fine dining restaurants the menu tends to evolve towards fish and vegetarian ingredients reserving meat for usually one single dish. In the case of La Dame de Pic, another meat dish would have been welcomed given the high quality of the venison one.

The white millefeuille was delicious, yet the birthday-special apple pie was rather average.

A great experience as such but a little extra was missing to ensure our second visit",0
788,"What is there to say that hasn’t already been said? Just a life changing experience, the tasting menu is a must, and every single dish is so perfectly curated and executed. The staff is wonderful and the wine was excellent. I’m very fortunate that I’ve had the opportunity to eat quite well in my life, but this meal was something particularly special. If you’re in the Basque Country you have to take advantage of the opportunity to sample some of the Michelin starred restaurants, and Arzak should be at the top of your list.",0
636,Was not disappointed with our second visit after so many years.,0
927,"Fresh off the high of excellent fine dining in Barcelona (Disfrutar, Tickets, Enigma), I was looking forward to my first three Michelin star experience in Spain. Not only does Arzak have three stars, it’s one of the rare World's 50 Best Restaurants to be headed by a female chef (no. 31 of 50). I even skipped Mugaritz (no. 9) the day before to give my stomach a break and fully appreciate the tasting menu at Arzak.

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with my lunch tasting menu experience. The food was fine, but not amazing - I enjoyed the small plates and desserts much more than the main courses which felt too flashy, yet uninspired and dated. A course came out on a color-changing tablet - money that could have been better spent on say, nicer wine glasses instead of their clunky ones.

What really let me down though were the sexist undertones. The sexism of the restaurant industry and general condoning of abusive behavior is no secret, but this was the first time I've actually felt uncomfortable as a diner at a fine dining establishment.

In contrast to confident females that were our primary servers at the other aforementioned restaurants, the female staff here seemed relegated to second-class citizens. They barely made eye contact or spoke, only serving to fold napkins with spoons (no hands allowed) and clear plates. A female stage chef hinted at her unhappiness and how she needed to think carefully about where to continue her career.

As for myself, I also experienced some interesting moments. I was taking notes in a small notebook, and the male maître d' asked my husband if he were a chef. Now it isn't a huge leap to see a diner take handwritten notes and assume they work in the industry, but I was the one taking notes here, not my husband. I guess I was the secretary?

Throughout the meal, the same maître d' was very alpha in his mannerisms. When I didn't finish the overcooked monkfish, he absolutely insisted I have another fish course. He was so confident I would eventually find one I liked.

After the multi-fish course ordeal, came the pigeon nonsense. When ordering, I said I wasn't a fan of pigeon, but the maître d' asserted that the pigeon was their star dish, so I got pigeon as my second main course. The female server that cleared my plate showed the nearly untouched remains to the maître d'. Of course he then came over and wanted me to have another course, but this time I had enough and didn't give in.

Right after this, Juan Mari Arzak (joint head chef with his daughter Elena) came over to greet the table, and Mr. Maître d' whispered into his ear (in front of us and twice!) about the pigeon. Juan didn't seem disappointed by that though, he was too busy calling me ""nice"" and pinching my cheek - yes he actually pinched my cheek! Elena, who I actually wanted to meet, was out of town.

After this experience and the forgettable food, I can't recommend Arzak. For other fine dining in San Sebastian, Asador Etxebarri is at the top of my must-try list. It's about an hour outside of the city and has nothing but rave reviews from everyone I've talked to personally, including the head chef at Enigma. My husband also enjoyed his solo experience at Mugaritz the day before.",1
98,"We had the pleasure of eating here for lunch on the weekend and it was incredible! One of the best meals I've ever eaten, every detail was superb. I especially enjoyed Les Berlingots, and can see why it's a signature dish. The pork was perfection too!
All the staff were excellent, and very welcoming, which really added to the experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you Chef Lopez and team!",0

Definitely a destination,l for foodies...We had the chef’s table in the kitchen, had the ever seasonal tasting menu and chatted to founding chef Juan Mari and his daughter Elena...The cuisine is inventive yet authentic, delicate and yet wholesome... It hits all the taste buds. Nothing contrived and totally delicious...",1
510,I came here for my wives birthday and got the taster menu. This has to be one of the best meals i have ever had. Because it was her birthday we got a free course and were taken down to meet the chef and given a loaf of bread to take home!,0
998,"It is a 3 Michelin star restaurant for a reason. The service is spectacular, the food is very very delicious, some dishes on the tasting menu are surprising but the final feeling is like something is missing for the price it is (very high, you can see it on the website). I left the restaurant, not hungry, but with the feeling that I could have eaten more. A lot more. The truth is that they give options to change dishes depending on tastes or allergies so it is flexible but for my taste there are not enough dishes, in other restaurants of this type they are more numerous and substantial.
Still spectacular.",0
434,This place is so heartwarming with a great hospitality and delicious dishes. Highly recommended!,0
214,"My wife and I had the most wonderful and memorable meal here last night. We really couldn't fault anything- service, attention to detail , and most importantly the food!. Highest compliments to the chef and the team here who treated us superbly. They deserve more than a Michelin star for what they have set out and created here. We had some dietary requirements which was accommodated so so well. Very impressed and for sure our new favourite restaurant in London. Cannot wait to come back. 🤗🥇",0
429,Excellent restaurant. The food is good and unique. The service great,0
407,"We had an extra night to spend in London before flying home and decided.to have a nice dinner. We chose The Ledbury based on reviews and we were not disappointed!

We had the vegetarian tasting menu (with one course modified for me since I don't like beets) along with the paired wines.

The food was great. The wines were a treat and matched each course perfectly. The staff was fabulous. The meal was an amazing experience that served as an exclamation point on our adventure in Europe.

We particularly enjoyed the very creative vegetarian courses. All were delicious and beautifully presented.

The meal was not inexpensive, but worth every penny! We are looking forward to the time when we can visit again.",0

The atmosphere is a bit more relaxed than other 2* Michelin restaurants and have to say, the quality of the food is up there with 3* restaurants such as Alain Ducasse and Gordon Ramsay.
Tasting menu (5) courses was fantastic and was a real treat.
Definitely dining there again.",0
