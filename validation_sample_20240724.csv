120,"Amazing!! Food was so delicious. Superb presentation. High cuisine techniques and flavour combinations. Incredible value for money - 3 dish set lunch at a 2 Michelin star restaurant in central London for ¬£45 - an absolute bargain! Complementary starters (3 different bite size eats), complementary bread and flavoured butter, and complementary tarts. Super nice and profesional staff. Great ambience and lots of natural light and space. I cannot fault it. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.",0
47,"Delicious, balanced taste. Not cheap (you can go on a small holiday from this) but one of the best meals I ever had! You close your eyes if you taste this. Although this establishment might seem a bit chique/stuck-up (has been around for lots of years), the staff is really nice and you get great views also.",0

586,The Ledbury specializes in French and English cuisine. Enjoy the exotic appetizers such as amuse-bouche to extraordinary main course seafood recipes and the signature brown tart desserts. The Ledbury offers a great range of desserts and also widely popular for its specialties.,0
256,"The most beautiful, instagramable food you will find. Service also perfect. Taste and paired wines are ok. Balance of flavours often a bit off (eg too much citrus with everything for our taste, especially in winter). Decor and Muzak also not quite our taste.",0
376,Only my second time at the Ledbury and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Innovative cuisine which changes on a regular basis unlike a lot of other Michelin starred restaurants. Not a large restaurant so be sure to book in advance.,0

770,"Tasting menu, amazing food and good service. English is still a bit of a challenge and that takes away something from the experience if one does not talk Spanish. Great respect for produce: little done to let them shine. Loved the amuse with chicken, the avocado ice cream was something out of this world and the duck was absolutely perfectly cooked. The marbled egg something to try again. Good wines as well to complement the dinner.",0
160,"Had a lot of food allergies so can‚Äôt have the tasting menu, just ordered wagyu main and mille fluille for dessert, too filling. They did serve you some small ‚Äúwelcoming treats‚Äù, which is nothing special. I came here alone for no special occasion, just want to taste the food and it‚Äôs convenient to reach here. Have to say wagyu was too greasy, when I had even fatter kobe wagyu in Japan it was not so greasy that I couldn‚Äôt finish, I know the chef already did her best, the companion veg was refreshing but the amount was too little so couldn‚Äôt match the beef.
The dessert was made of ‚Äúspecial yogurt cream‚Äù but I still find it too greasy. I am not an extremely picky person, but maybe that night I just chose wrong dish. Hopefully there will be special occasion that someone ask me to come here again to have a different experience.
The service was good, avoided all my allergies. I heard that the table next to me highly praised the wine and bread, they ordered a lot recurrently. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt drink alcohol, so can‚Äôt enjoy the speciality here.",0
716,One of my favour restaurant in London.  The services and the foods are excellent.,0
200,"Excellent and very floral cuisine.
Unfortunately the coffee was quite poor, especially for a restaurant with such standards.
Knowing this, you can choose from a sublime tea selection though.",0
432,"The Ledbury really is worth a visit to forget about the outside world and to be spoilt and enjoy some fantastic plates of food.
One feature to this restaurant is that all the tables have a great view next too the large windows.
We started the meal with a glass of champagne with an abundant selection of canap√©s.The high lights of the meal for me being the chalk stream trout with shiso and the muntjac dear‚Ä¶.the grated heart on a piece of aubergine was so creamy and smoky and the dumpling  to with hints of spruce.
We finished the meal with some blackcurrant pastille rolled in some exotic sugar that my brain has erased and the classic chocolate truffle all elevated with the Ledbury twist.
We also had the pleasure to meet Brett and thank him for looking after ourselves and our son who had been before.
One member of staff of note was Josh who was a pleasure to be served by‚Ä¶.keep doing what you do‚Ä¶.and thank you.",1

764,"If I could give 6 stars I would! Arzak was the most incredible fine dining experience of my life so far. The food was of course exceptional with the pigeon being a highlight: it was outstanding. What elevated Arzak was the homely, friendly feel: it was a joyous evening in which I not only enjoyed the food, but smiled throughout because of the friendly and good humoured service. We had the tasting menu, but this was tailored to ensure we both had individual experiences; albeit shared. Without question one of the highlights of my gastronomic journey so far. Thank you!",0
692,Best meal I‚Äôve had in London. Service is exemplary as well.,0
938,"I have to commend Elena Arzak for successfully balancing the reputation of her father, who is now just a distant memory, from the new cooking she has brought in. While the team is still largely the same: Mariano, the sommelier, has been working there for 38 years, the dishes bring a fantastic new wave of ideas and flavors. Wonderful work and Arzak is back on my top list.",1

In regards to price, well priced but worth!!!",0
27,"All in all it was a great evening. Got to see the sunset during the meal and nice concept with all the different spices around the world. There were several dishes though that were overly salted and I thought three courses of dessert was a bit heavy. I would‚Äôve been happy with only the first one, with the nice clean citrusy note to end the evening. Just my two cents.",0
618,"They have amazing food, probably the best in London. Although its a bit costly, but totally worth it. Couldnt have been better.",0
248,"Sadly it was a huge disappointment. Our first waiter ( with spikey hair) had an issues with offering me gluten free items/ I am allergic to options - he made faces when I said I cannot have beetroot amuse-bouche - I cannot. After forgetting about the orders 4th times he seemed to lose his patience and basically threw my little plate on the table which I took in silently due to respect to other guests.
Our glasses were never filled up with water without asking, we were waiting 3 times for Evian more than 15 mins,  similarly with gluten free rolls. Constant mistakes - asked for salad without any dressing I received it dressed etc.   Restaurant was not busy at all and pretty empty.
Food - bread was very nice, langoustine also lovely, light and flavours go together well. John Dory overcooked terribly with not matching sauce - absolutely coffee cocoa jus doesn't go well with it. I left almost the entire dish untouched.  Food was arriving very delayed.  Thankfully then I had a bread with butter to snack on. Definitely not what I was expecting in the slightest unfortunately. No one ever was checking up on us.  Wouldn't recommend unfortunately.",0
835,"I ate at Arzak for the first time in 1987 and have been back dozens of times since then. I have never been disappointed. The food is constant evolving, and always delicious. Do the tasting menu (you don't all have to have the same things!)",0

We both absolutely loved the food....honestly it was flawless, both in terms of presentation and taste....that Brown Sugar Tart....sweet Jesus ....its perfect. The front of house staff were just the best, I was truly touched at the kindness they extended to my daughter. Don't know if you guys read these reviews, tbh I don't really like writing them, but I wanted to say thank you once again, for giving us such a memorable evening........my daughter literally floated out of your restaurant on a happy, warm, fuzzy cloud. Thank you for the outstanding food, and for your thoughtful kindness.",0

The menu is acceptable, however, it does not surprise in flavors or textures or creativity. It is easy to make a good dish with a good product. If you put it at half price, it would still be excessive.",0
479,London has a lot of good restaurants and this is one of the greatest.  Everything is so refined and well done but not pretentious or precious.  Exceptional service with great guidance through the seasonal menu.  A deep and varied wine list as one would expect but it features great bottles at entry as well as top level.  Everyone how loves eating must eat here once.,0

Excellent ingredients cooked with excellent technique.

Merci,

Allez les Bleus!",0

Without it we would have stayed hungry.
Very small portions, kind of tastings, which can not be said about their prices.
Some of the tastings were really good, the rest were mediocre.",0
879,A good dining experience with my friends in Arzak. Impressive quality and work for the Degustation Menu. Not a 5/5 for 2 reasons : service a bit messy for food and wines (poor explanations) & the pairing really too expensive for the wine ‚Ä¶,0
548,I brought my wife here last week and our experience was really great. The Ledbury has great and tasty selection of foods that is worth every penny spent. Great! Your deserve to have a 5-star or  more!,0

900,"We hit up a San Pelligrino list restaurant, or sometimes a couple, every year for our anniversary. We went to Spain this year primarily to go to Tickets. That's a great experience in and of itself but I'll stick to Arzak.

We made the trip to San Sebastian and Arzak almost as an afterthrought. It was great. In fact, it was my wife's favorite meal of all time and not the many world class restaurants we've hit up over the years. The service was good, if not exceptional. The restaurant environment and ambiance has a good vibe. The wine selection was okay; the glasses are limited. The food however was the key. The presentation was excellent and there was not an ""eh"" or bad serving on the tasting menu. The whole experience was delicious. Highly recommend.",0
110,"What a place to eat!
The service was amazing with attentive and knowledgeable staff and they make you feel welcome and treasured.
The food is to just die for!  I‚Äôve eaten many amazing meals but this is just spectacular‚Ä¶ everything is a taste experience of such amazing ingredients that just work and the presentation of the food is sublime.
My favourite dishes were the signature dish of sea bass and caviar and the Scottish langoustine.
The cleverest dishes were the tiny tarts of turbot and pumpkin tarts as well as the cheese course. This was a cheese mousse with fig pur√©e and a tiny, thin cracker on top just perfect. The wine pairing was needed to make this extra special and it was our anniversary and they brought out a special finishing touch . A perfect evening and worth every penny for such an incredible dining experience‚Ä¶ thank you",1
852,Best restaurant I've ever been. No wonder it is one of the best restaurants in the world. Pricey but worth the experience. Lots of flavors that come together like a symphony. Extensive wine list very reasonably priced.,0
341,"This restaurant definitely lives up to its fame - a Michelin two starred. Upon entry, you‚Äôd already be attracted by its fancy decorations and elegant ambience. Every dish served was a piece of artwork carefully cooked and presented. Though some of the taste were not my cup of tea. There were some in the Christmas set which I was truly in love with, such as the lobster soup(served cold), cod, and the lamb shoulder. Some food is best to be served cold so you can taste the most flavor out of it - perfectly demonstrated by the lobster soup. The cod was the finest cod I‚Äôve had in London, very tender which made a great combination with the sauce. However, surprise never stopped in the Ledbury, the milk-fed lamb shoulder was super tender and flavorsome. I really hope that they had more of it on my plate(there was also lamb legs which was also tender but not as good as the shoulder). The Christmas tart was a nice combination of ginger and cinnamon, a good seasonal treat for the end of a nice Christmas meal. If you were to try the normal set, the brown sugar tart is a must try!!!
PS. One of my friend really appreciated their bread, and the restaurant gave us a whole loaf to take home for free!!! This pushed my expectation of ‚Äòservice‚Äô to a whole new level. Well done!!!",1
999,"I have eaten the tasting menu and the truth is that I was disappointed because it wasn't bad because it wasn't. If not, because if you go to a 3 star restaurant for a 250 euro menu, I think you have to go out trying different flavors and the only thing really different was the fish of the day and the fish was not the size of your little toe in 3 parts. I have been to others like stretxo and I still remember each dish. Of course, the treatment was very exclusive and they were very attentive to us at all times and in the end they told us if we wanted to repeat any dish.",0
289,"We had a truly wonderful evening the food was superb excellent service
I highly recommend this restaurant",0
202,"A very interesting meal with tasty food! Unusual flavour combinations and definitely one for a special occasion. One course was cold and had to be sent back without anything being removed from the bill - which was a bit surprising. We were also given a wrong dessert but they‚Äôd provided an extra one as an apology for cold food (although they did this to all tables) and so it wasn‚Äôt an issue. But just a few problems that you wouldn‚Äôt expect from a 2* restaurant. We‚Äôd go back though, hopefully it was just a one off bad day.",0
19,"I‚Äôve never spent so much money to feel hungry.

The view is great, the service is great, and the presentation is fantastic. The bread, handmade butter, and desert, were fantastic.

But beyond that there was a lot more show in this place than substance. 3 of the 5 courses were not tasty to me. I left feeling hungry.

Paying this much for a meal was a significant splurge for us, far beyond what we‚Äôve ever paid, and the food was not far beyond what we‚Äôve ever experienced.",0

833,"this is my favorite three star restaurant. the food is amazing and with a 4 person party you could try one of every option. although, I think everyone who chose the hake instead of the shrimp regretted not getting the shrimp. this is the best cooked shrimp we've ever had. the head is perfectly cooked so you can get the sweetness from the shrimp ""butter"" and the rest of the shrimp is great as well. the hake is amazing too but you need to give up the shrimp to get it. we tried everything except the foie for the main red meat course and the restaurant's rankings of the options matched our table's rankings ( i.e. get the pigeon).

the service here is flawless and accommodating. we've been to 3 stars all over the world and this wait staff is the only one that balances genuine care with great execution.

they are also really kind to child diners here. they provide a la carte options for younger diners and included them in the amuse and after meal chocolate so they wouldn't feel left out.",0

Some of the highlights, after service, which was fantastic; a brined tartare fish (mackerel) w Jerusalem artichokes , the pigeon, along with monk fish, and the hors d' oeuvres, were thoughtful and a blend of simplicity and complexity. The staff is kind enough to give you a quick directive on each dish, Deserts were light, and true art, but we are partial to salt. You will need a reservation, and know there is only tasting menu, which with out wine pairing is 240‚Ç¨, I believe the wine pairing was 430‚Ç¨, took us a bit by surprise for lunch. They are a fair amount of casually dressed tourists, no stress on attire.",0
262,"I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. We took our Christmas dinner here and their Christmas menu was awful. My girl said that the only good thing was their bread~~Service is ok, except that the waiter admitted that he forgot the recipe.

Not having a dress code yet the atmosphere is warm and very cosy. The presentation of food is what is expected of a fine dining restaurant, the taste is great. Loved executed dish expect for Deer. But it could be that I was already too full by the time I got there and I personally am not a fan of anything too Gamey in taste. The restaurant catered for my partners onion and garlic minor allergy by excluding it in his meal which is very nice as it‚Äôs sometimes quite hard to cater for that. Overall a very nice restaurant & would def go back when the menu is updated as it‚Äôs a degustation only so not much to choose from really but they do cater if there is a dish you don‚Äôt like and more than happy to swap it out.",1

918,"Arzak did not meet my expectations; although the food was good (especially the lamb and the pigeon) it was not very special / innovative, no wow factor. The St Pellegrino website said the restaurant had a great view but there was no view.

Although the restaurant has been in the Arzak family for ages, it did not feel as a family restaurant and the interior of the restaurant was very modern and rather cold.

One dish was served on an extremely old Philips tablet which was a bit odd and did not add to the experience.

The staff was nice however their English language skills were rather limited which probably added to our (lack of) experience.

Many other restaurants in the area which I would check out before going to Arzak.",0

63,"Truly lives upto its michelin stars. It's one of the best places in Amsterdam for a great dinner, amazing service and beautiful view of the city. The caviar is one of the specials of the place - make sure you try it out whilst there.
There was so much of good stuff here - it's difficult to break it down. All I can say is that we spent 5 hours for our dinner and it was special in every which way - food, service, ambience and view.",0
923,"Unless you are close to being penniless, and even then find some way, do not even contemplate spending time in Donostia-San Sebasti√°n without going to Arzak. This restaurant is, in so many ways, what a good restaurant should be and deliver. It does deliver!

Sometimes when you have high expectations and, why wouldn‚Äôt you, because Elena Arzak has presently been voted the top female chef in the world. After lunching there several weeks ago it did not come at all as a surprise. From the time, we stepped in the front door to the time we were escorted out of the front door the service; the food, the staff, the ambience, the d√©cor and the experience were faultless. The restaurant is presently undergoing renovation on the outside so it was a little unprepossessing when we arrived. However, as soon as we stepped inside all of that was swept away.
We were fortunate enough to have Elena come out and take us for a tour of the kitchen. It was a reliable indication in its calm orderly and efficient atmosphere of the gastronomic experience to follow. I think that was prompted by my wife having been to one of her master classes in Melbourne. The world is a small place. Elena had purchased one of her favourite dresses from Lisa Gorman in Melbourne. Lisa lives 100 meters down the street from us. However, back to the experience.

After being seated in the restaurant, Elena was gracious enough to make some suggestions and variations on her degustation menu. I have attached a copy of that menu, and frankly, I would have been happy to eat anything from it. As my wife does not drink red wine we generally compromise on Ros√©. Arzak have their in-house Ros√©, which is delightfully dry and crisp. It was a more than a satisfactory match for the food. Sometimes life is a compromise, for that matter, so is marriage.
Elena is married to an architect who has overseen a wonderfully understated renovation of the restaurant. The wait staff was attentive and professional without being obsequious. They were pleased to explain the dishes, which came at a perfect pace.

We were fortunate to meet Elena‚Äôs father who started this restaurant and who still greets the customers at each table. Elena herself is articulate, extremely friendly and quietly in complete control of her establishment.
I am thrilled we went for lunch, not because I think the evening meal or experience would be any less, but simply it did give me the chance to digest one of the best meals I have ever tasted and to have time to think about it before going to bed on a full stomach. Seriously, do not leave town without going to Arzak.",1
263,"Brilliant would be an understatement. Sheer bliss, great food, good wine list & excellent staff who explained in detail everything you were going to eat. One minor fault, lighting at table poor, aggravated by the small typeface on menu, torch from mobile phone used.",0
708,"Tasting menu, wine list - incredible. Probably worth more than 2 stars.",0
59,"Mind blowing culinary experience! Each dish here is a piece of art. Service, wine pairing, drinks and the view: all wonderful.  It is quite pricy but worth for an extraordinary experience. Michellin 2 star is very well deserved.",0

325,"What a delightful experience. We went for dinner and we really enjoyed every minute. The staff are very attentive and super welcoming and friendly. Every dish served was a pleasant experience, although I would have preferred larger portions to enjoy the taste longer üòÇ The dishes are served over 3 hours. Overall we really enjoyed it for a special occasion, as the food served is quite unique to the restaurant, they are not common dishes that you can find at other restaurants. Overall, you pay for the experience (¬£250 pp).",0

111,"Entering the restaurant was extremely grand. Service staff were extremely polite and attentive.

We selected the voyager tasting experience and were dissatisfied with the meal.

Execution and balance of the tasting menu was extremely disappointing. All the dishes were quite full flavoured and over powering ‚Ä¶. it was too much on the palette. High recommend for slot in some lighter dishes to provide the palette a break ;-) Chef did use amazing ingredients were top notch and super fresh.

Scallop was best executed but over salted. Butter was just too experimental for me.

It‚Äôs a real shame ;-) don‚Äôt think we will be back again.",0
134,"An absolutely remarkable place to enjoy a true dining experience. The menu is particularly well designed on the drinking side which is often left to be ""wine only"". We went for a 6 course meal as a couple and were stunned by the journey. The service was also 5 stars!",0
485,"Update 25.09.17:

It has been few years since I have been to the Ledbury and I have to say it is still top. The food I feel is even better than on my last visit and the service as attentive as always.

This restaurant is one of the top restaurants in the world for a reason! Anybody who is lucky to get a table should definitely come and try it out for yourself you will not regret it (well not at least until you get the bill ^^)

Ps: and if you do get a chance try to say hello to the kitchen team and chef graham they deserve a big thank you too!

Old review 2015:

Booked for my birthday and it was the first time I ever visited a 2 star michelin star restaurant.

I have to say I do really enjoyed the whole experience. The service was definitely one of the best I have ever experienced. The presentation of the food was also very nice.

We had the tasting menu and the lamb was probably the best I ever had in my life.

The only nick picking would be that a fruit fly landed into my wine glass but a staff member was helpful enough to fish it out for me.

For sure a restaurant worth visiting and recommending.

Cheers!",0
581,"World class tasting menu with excellent service.
Try to meet chef graham and his team if you are lucky and got a table here. This restaurant deserves to be in the top 50 restaurants on the planet",0
517,"The most amazing lunch I've ever had. The service is phenomenal, the attention to detail is by far the best I have seen. Lunch menu is accessible and not too expensive. The dishes were amazing. Highly recommended !",0
784,Amazing place if you want to know why San Sebastian is one of the world's food capitals. Each dish was extremely well thought through and tasted great. Service was a bit harsh but this is Spain after all. Had some great wines and a truly tremendous time.,0
478,Really good food. Nice atmosphere - not too stuffy or pretentious. Staff were excellent. Very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu.,0
885,"This restaurant is over-rated  , bread was cold & not properly presented .
Food was so so & i really can‚Äôt accept that slow cook onzen egg was over-cooked for a famous 3 michelin star restaurant. Ingredients are not special . Really not worth to try . Many restaurants in San Sabastian can do much better .",0
545,"Okay so straight up I was pouting about going here - last time I stepped foot through these doors I was 10 years ago - i was midway through a bad relationship and all we focused on was espresso martinis ( they were incredible here btw ) and staying up until 5am...

a larger than life bill with dinner untouched and a half cut girlfriend meant that my experience here before was dreadful, almost as bad as my hangover the next day!

Now, a little older... maybe not wiser - as soon as we were seated... bang. My smile really did turn upside down. We dined as a four and sat near the corner - service was incredible, it‚Äôs like the waiter could hear my thoughts...! The wine was excellent and dinner slipped down easily... the bill was expensive, even for the area - but well worth it.",0
210,"Firstly,  the service was brilliant! Professional,  friendly staff.  However, apart from the steak tartare, the food was confusing on the palette and unbalanced.  Very strange for a 2 Michelin star restaurant.  There is a fine line between experimenting and good flavour combinations which was comprised on this occasion. All of us around the table agreed that the beautiful looking plates,  with clearly good cooking techniques just tasted strange verging on unpleasant. Thank you to the staff though for making the overall experience positively memorable. Watch out,  I might steal your team for my next venture! üòÄ",0
348,"As good a meal as i've eaten in a long long time. The price point is high so only for those very special occasions but it delivered a memorable and truly delicious experience on our visit. The staff could not have been more charming, informative and considerate whilst the sommelier picked some great wine pairings for our meal. The high end modern European dining scene can be accused of pretentiousness and overdone formality but the atmosphere here was warm and inviting. For those who like modern European food this will surely delight and amaze.",0
459,"One of our best dining experiences. The service was spot on and every course of the tasting menu was delicious, innovative and absolutely beautiful. The wine pairings worked perfectly. This restaurant deserves all the praise it receives and more.",0

83,"Best gastronomical moment of my life, great staff, perfection was in every dish, worth every penny. Thanks so much to everyone, it was magical.",0
139,"The food here was excellent and beautifully presented as it should be, even for a set lunch menu. The wagyu tartare was a little lost as having a cold sorbet on top killed any flavour you could get from the meat. Whilst I wasn't convinced by the mille feuille, it was definitely a dessert that stood out above the  pear alternative (and though delightful, not worth the full ¬£19 price tag!) What lost them my rating was the fact at lunch when people are usually on schedules, it took asking three times before we got our order taken. Not because they were rushing to do something else, but because ""a manager"" has to take it. Service standard overkill, it irritates people more to ask three times than to get someone who can't explain the menu fully (which we didn't need), common sense issue really. We also saw someone's desserts sitting on the side deflating for at least eight minutes before being served, and the gap between our main and dessert was also extensive despite saying we didn't need a gap. I'd still recommend this place, ignore the ""service"" though the staff were pleasant enough, the food was excellent at lunch time costs but for the type of restaurant this is, everything should be seamless.",0
455,"Went here with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. We could not have left this place being happier.

We chose the 7 course taster menu, every single meal was delicious and had a lovely design to it. The waiter we had was very nice and helpful. he explained every dish to us and made our entire experience pleasant.

The staff was very attentive and professional,and the food was simply ecstatic.
I went fro the tasting menu with wines,and i was not disappointed.

For a Michelin star restaurant , it would have been normal for them to present an Amuse Bouche and a wider variety of petite fours which was lacking here.
Nevertheless, it was a great experience and highly recommend it",0

778,"This was a lovely experience. Regardless of the Micheline stars and history, it was a very relaxing and casual dinner. Three of us had the tasting menu without the wine paring and it was fine to consult on wine with the sommelier on two good bottles of basque Txakoli wine to start and an excellent bottle of red to end. The presentation was simple and lovely and the favors were astoundingly good. We opted for different options each for the mains and shared them with great results if you are up for that. The price is also stunning: $954 for three people with 2 bottles of wine. But still, this was a pilgrimage for us and part of the whole reason to be in San Sebastian in the first place.",0
939,"3 Michelin star, the Bocuse of Spain.  Building, food philosophy and dishes and plating reflects a different era. literally the most famous restaurant in San Sebastian.",0
516,"Oh, Ledbury, your divineness knows no bounds! What more can I possibly add to the previous reviews singing your praises? One reviewer perfectly described the food as 'rightness.' All the flavours are fresh and unique and it's just fun to eat- the mackerel is superb. Perhaps the only thing I can add to all the other reviews is to praise the service. One of the managers was also American and spent a good deal of time talking to us about the menu (he knew EVERYTHING!), the restaurant's and chef's backgrounds, and just about restaurants in general and comparing the American and British food scenes. He was really friendly without being overbearing and seemed to genuinely love his work and want to make it an enjoyable evening for us. The staff literally anticipated everything and knew what we wanted before we did, which made the whole experience totally relaxing and you never had to worry about something going awry. These are clearly professionals. If I won the lottery tomorrow, the first thing I would do is go eat at the Ledbury. Actually, even if I don't win the lottery I will go back and eat at the Ledbury- it's worth it.",1
762,"Excellent meal; the food was delicious and very cool/inventive, fantastic presentation. The service was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself could use an update; the setup is a bit strange and the decor a bit dated, but it‚Äôs fine. A wonderful experience overall.",0
752,"There is quite simply nothing that compares to Arzak. We have been blessed to experience multiple Michelin Three Star restaurants and all are wonderful culinary symphonies. What elevates Arzak is the art of hospitality. There is no pretentiousness, no judgment of the guest. If there is something you don‚Äôt prefer on the tasting menu, the service team effortlessly comes up with a different plan and verifies that it will work for you.

Chef Elena makes multiple passes through the dining room, meaningfully engaging with her guests and even referencing previous talking points. I have never witnessed this behavior at an establishment of this caliber.

The team has passion for their craft, loves their guests and are led with inspiration. Guess what. You taste it in the food‚Ä¶it has soul.

Cesar served us years ago when a relative of a colleague booked a reservation, and we had done no research to know what we were getting into. When we told him we couldn‚Äôt handle a full tasting menu, he crafted something that gave us the essence of the Arzak experience and it was exquisite. Cesar arranged a tour of the kitchen and even took a photo with me. I never forgot Cesar‚Äôs hospitality.

Imagine my surprise last week when Cesar began reviewing the tasting menu with the table next to us! The night ended with a long conversation about how Cesar had found his way to Arzak and the special brand of hospitality that can be found there.

If you have to choose one meal, this is it.",1
483,"Incredible dining experience in a friendly environment. One of the best restaurants in the world, definitely my favourite in London, the dishes are full of surprises and are exceptionally crafted. What makes this place stand out is also the quality and friendliness of the service that you don't find anywhere else. Also note that service included in the prices.",0
755,The food is as great as advertised. Every course exceeded our expectations. Great service and very friendly. Elena even visited our table twice. I didn‚Äôt know that I needed fried garlic soup or corn ice cream in my life until today. Ignore the negative reviews and trust the experts at Michelin,1
9,"Located on the 23rd floor of the Okura Hotel (where we were staying) Ciel Bleu is a rather classic but nonetheless amazing fine dining restaurant with a beautiful view on Amsterdam. I found the ambience definitely less formal then expected (positive not for me) mostly because of the great job of the waiters.
We opted for the season menu with the modern wine pairing and were definitely satisfied with the quality and quantity of what we had. Everything is balanced, perfectly executed and made with the finest ingredients.
As a little extra you can end the night in the lounge, absolutely recommended.",0

She is a very nice friendly Lady and give us some tips where to go for excellent Pinxtos in Old City Center.

It would great if the Table setting not next to each other. We had 2 Russian Lady next to our Table and they were very Loud.

It needs space and tranquil Atmosphere. We didn‚Äôt feel romantic to celebrate our Love here.

252,"One thing can be said about today's extended  lunch here, not only fine dining, but also fun dining. Lovely space, with 5m tall ceilings, airy with almost casual, yet beautiful air. The welcome and the service I received from personable and affable restaurant manager Nicolas Bierry, and his  staff, including Alvin, was much appreciated. The sous chef Giacomo Tranquili made his head chef proud by getting to my table a perfectly cooked quail, which first comes out in a smoking cast iron dish, and then is beautifully served with, again, a perfectly cooked piece of foie gras. Scottish langostines were good, desserts I don't really get excited about, even here, though the tea selection was a nice touch (go with Alvin's recommendation!). Fab experience I would like to repeat before too long.",1
989,"I know her daughter from the times I have been here, but not her famous father, but I can say about her that she was treated unbeatably and with a lot of education.

In this restaurant I don't order from the menu, nor from the typical tasting menu, but what I do is always take advice because they are usually right and completely right.

The day of the Tamborrada El Maestro is truly a spectacle and really animates the party. It is a shame that it is extremely difficult to reserve that day since the diners on that day come back practically all of them, absolutely every year.

The treatment by the staff is unbeatable, not a gentleman's treatment, it is a friendly approach that is greatly appreciated.

I highlight the quality of the products they use in all their dishes, although there are dishes that I don't like, it's not because of them, it's just because there are some things that I don't like, but the people I've been to tell me they are incredible.

I love that mix of traditional Basque with touches of modernity that they experience every year. What I do see as very positive is that year after year they want to improve and they do not stagnate or rest on their laurels.

I have to highlight a great selection of wines that they have.",0
103,"Walked in for lunch. It is located in Four Season Hotel Trinity Square next to tower bridge. Very high ceiling and high end decorated.
The dining atmosphere is very formal and the space between tables is big.
The service is professional and efficient.
The plating of all dishes is obsoletely beautiful. The taste of the food is complex but well balanced. I like all the dishes. Enjoyed my lunch very much.",0
274,Amazing dining experience. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Service was fab too. I'd highly recommend it.,0
882,"I came with such expectations for the legendary restaurant. Sadly they‚Äôre trapped in the past. Would never receive three stars today, and some of the sloppiness makes me even question if they‚Äôd receive one (creased menus?!). Lovely staff, but need to try harder.",0
336,"Had an absolutely fantastic lunch here just before Christmas. Service is awesome; friendly, helpful and unassuming. The food was fabulous; innovative, creative, excellent quality and great flavours. Highly recommended. Go now before they get their Michelin stars back!",0
864,"The food was delightful but we suffered terrible food poisoning from the lunch. All 8 of us had the tasting menu & everyone either threw up or had diarrhea after that. It was so bad that my daughter nearly fainted and had to be hospitalized. It spoilt our entire holiday as we only recovered from the ordeal 3-4 later. Arzak refused to admit that it was their fault and was defensive and claimed that we were the only ones that suffered the food poisoning. We have been to so many Michelin star restaurants around the world and this is the first time we have ever suffered gastroenteritis from a Michelin starred  restaurant. Thanks to Arzak, San Sebasti√°n will be remembered as our trauma trip. They definitely have to improve their food handling!!!",0

415,An unbelievable restaurant in every way. A little slice of heaven in Notting Hill. From the service to the dishes and drinks there is care for every detail. A truly memorable experience.,0
589,"Amazing food at the Ledbury. We went for the lunch menu, a four course meal which came with multiple amuse-bouche, a pre-desert, and petit fours, paired with delicious wines. Great food, great service, and an overall memorable experience.",0
912,"Colorful, creative and delicious.  It's inventive but  I wouldn't qualify it as entirely unique nor off the charts.  Some of the dishes were gimmicky, the tv under the glass plate, for instance.  The skateboard?  All well and good but the food has to really shine and it didn't always.  The sommelier was the reason I dropped this rating to 3.  Entirely rushed, too busy to take any time for questions about the wine and blurted out his answers while closing the wine menu to end our discussion.  Fortunately our sever recognized our disappointment in that engagement and stepped in to fill in the gaps left by his lack of service.  A surprising miss considering the Michelin 3 star rating.",0
176,"We came for a casual lunch, the service and atmosphere are standard for a fine dinning restaurant. Very disappointed with the food experience though, some dishes were overcooked and too heavy on cheese /cream in general.",0

866,"Came here for dinner during by honeymoon trip. First time to a Michelin 3 star restaurant and it definitely did not disappoint.

Had an amazing meal and the service was excellent. We really wanted to try their tasting menu but felt it would have been too much food for us. So instead of having us order a la carte dishes they let us order customized 4 course tasting menu instead.

Although I found one of my dish (monk fish) a little too salty, they took care of me by immediately replacing it with a different dish. Elena even came out herself to check to ensure everything was OK. It was. The replacement along with everything else was delicious.

Love this restaurant. Will return.",1
277,Beautiful food. Sauces were too salty but service perfect. The original location in Valence is much better.,0
594,Best meal I've had in London. Every course of a very high standard with service being excellent. Can see why this is consistently ranked as one of the best restaurants in the world.,0
243,Impeccable service and just a wonderful experience. It was hard to choose as everything looked delicious but the legendary millefeuille is a must.,0
500,"Spent the afternoon here trying their tasting menu (6 hours in total). Service was great - professional and friendly. The restaurant manager was most accommodating when taking our order, re-adjusting the menu where required unlike some other restaurants of a similar level. The atmosphere was relaxed yet formal enough providing a high standard of service. The wine list is extensive with an Austrian selection of wines which I find rarely seen outside Austria. The dishes themselves are fantastic: both individual and combination of tastes and textures can be clearly distinguished giving some surprising combinations in tasting experience. Would definitely recommend the tasting menu which is seasonal.",0
38,"It's a good place to dine, good food, good service and good produce. It's a place to go once, but maybe that's about it. There's better offers in Amsterdan for the same price and quality.",0
130,"Overall the experience was good and the place amazing.Staff was very good,polite and attentive but unfortunately we faced some issues.We informed the staff twice for our taste preferences, I received a dish with goat cheese which I couldnt consume at all but they manage to change after I mentioned it for third time. Food stages were skipped, we had the fish course before the starter. Spent 03:00 - 3:30 hours for an 8 course menu. Sourdough with butter and cornish crab were the best.",0
102,"We have been to La Dame de Pic a few times when they had only a star and it always have been one of our favorite place to have lunch. We are back for lunch today and the cooking was beat our expectations, honestly better than the other 2 female chefs who has 3 stars in London. We had the journey menu, and it was the perfect quantity for lunch. My favorite dish was the whiskey soaked tomato and the cured sweetbread before was very innovative!
We also thought it was very nice for the restaurant to allow free corkage up to a bottle to let fine dining become more accessible to younger people",0
537,"Best restaurant in London. Incredible food; the chefs led by Brett Graham have designed each course of the tasting menu (regular and vegetarian) to be outstanding and completely different from each other. The curd of buffalo milk with truffle toast is a favourite as is the passion fruit souffle with sauternes ice cream.
The wine pairings are chosen very well by a good sommelier who really knows each wine.
Relaxed atmosphere and great service from friendly staff.
I have been there twice for the tasting menu with wine pairings and plan to return soon. I believe this should get the third star in the near future; it'll be be well deserved!",1
447,My husband and I had dinner Feb 3rd for our anniversary. A congratulations card awaited on the table when we arrived.  Gorgeous tasting menu with a number of delicious extras. Staff was friendly and unpretentious. Setting was stylish and relaxing. Looking forward to our next visit!,0

730,"Food amazing , service excellent  well worth a visit .",0
189,"Underwhelmed I think sums up my experience on a recent visit for dinner. Great surroundings and attentive and friendly staff are I hope a given at such an establishment but the food was not as notable as I had hoped. I am not a foodie but I felt the selection provided (in the club menu option) did not have the wow factor one hopes for. I also find it a bit irritating when the waiter, usually often with a strong foreign accent, announces all the ingredients of the current dish, leaving me little the wiser. I would prefer to retain the menu so I can review what I am eating as I eat it. Surely an important reason for going to an expensive restaurant is the food and understanding the tastes being offered. I have no major criticism of the restaurant (apart from being rather hidden away) but I would not recommend it even for special occasions such as ours.",0
801,"Great food. Top tip for those from the US (about >60% of your clientele, it appears) ... You may not want to brand all of your female servers with a scarlet letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù. It has a slightly different meaning to us who remember high school English class.",0
303,Good food and strong wine list. Would come back for drinks.,0

97,"A fantastic experience. The tasting menu takes you on a marvelous ride along a road full of flavor and texture. Every single plate and bite was enjoyable and memorable.
The place has a refined taste, and they take care of every tiny aspect so you get the best time. The best moment of the evening was when the chef L√≥pez came to introduce himself to the table and asked us to go with him and meet the kitchen and the staff behind the curtains.
All that you could expect from a two-star Michelin Restaurant you will find it here.",1

5 star experience",0

884,"The food is not bad but given the quality of food in San Sebastian, it's hard to consider the value of what you're getting.
We got the the tasting menu and were very glad that we could chop and change some of the dishes to others on the menu. The experience was quite pleasant with Elena coming out and having a brief chat. Asir the Maitre d was lovely and explained the restaurant, it's cuisine and ingredients very well.
Overall, save the money on the wonderful pinxtos bars instead.",1
15,"Ciel Bleu is truly one of the most outstanding restaurants I've ever had the pleasure to dine at. My partner and I had the 'Guestronomy' taster menu for my 32nd birthday this week and it certainly went down a treat.

The service was perfect, the food was perfect, the view was perfect, everything was absolutely perfect! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough and will almost certainly be back again in the future.

Special thanks to Jane and Mandy from the floor staff and chef Arjan Speelman who went to every effort to make it the great experience that it was. Many thanks in addition for the very kind signed menu!",1
1,"Diner at Ciel Bleu is a truly fantastic experience.
Located on the 23rd floor of Hotel Okura, Ciel Bleu offers an amazing dining experience, supplemented by an exceptional view over Amsterdam.

From entering the restaurant and throughout the evening, Ciel Bleu staff is there to comfort your every need. Service is exceptional, as can be expected from a restaurant operating at 2-star level for over 15 years. Timings of the dishes is aligned, wine is presented at the right time, everything is orchestrated just flawlessly.

The ambiance is comfortable, grey and white tones with thought-out lighting. Seats are very pleasant, and the way the tables and seats are arranged offers a great deal of privacy. For the view, try arranging a window seat, it is worth it.

Food is of the highest standard. Combination of flavours is complex but balanced. A few photos are attached, though they hardly do the dishes justice. All dishes are presented well, and the wine pairing lifts them to the next level. Personal highlights were the Seabass and A5 Wagyu beef, along with the chocolate dessert.

Fully recommend Ciel Bleu for an unforgettable gastronomic experience. The food, service and setting are simply top notch.",0
929,Amazing food and a very gracious host. Thank you  Elena!,1
318,"We recently visited the Ledbury for a special event. They were super organised with congratulatory messages on cards for us.
The service was great and so was the personal attention to us. I guess that‚Äôs expected as it‚Äôs a two Michelin star restaurant. As usual good wine list and loads of wines to choose from even wines by glass. As expected it‚Äôs pricey and we know whenever we visit a top Michelin restaurant the prices in central London will be quite steep ( so be prepared for that )
We had the tasting menu which was really nice and some pictures are attached to my note. You wouldn‚Äôt expect to like everything but most of the courses very delicious.
Verdict 5/5
Budget easily ¬£250/- per person and more depending on how / which wines you choose",1
698,Simply fantastic. The food and the team are world class.,0
901,"Very creative, artful, colorful, rich in substance. The staff is welcoming, friendly, working like bees to satisfy all tables. The menu de d√©gustation is smart and flexible as one can choose, and the quantity leaves a person satisfied, not over stuffed, a wide selection of wine is good.",0

The moment you leave your dining chair masks must be on, if you forget, you will be reminded instantly and offered a disposable one if necessary - politely but firmly, you feel safe. They had only been open two days when we went, but the entire staff are engaging and warm. We were admiring the stunning photo series of Karl Lagerfeld and immediately offered a tour telling us about each one. They are part of a very exciting Afternoon Themed Tea which will be really fun. It was expensive, but good value,  a really fabulous afternoon.",1

112,"A true fine dining experience in a stunning venue

Within the Four Season Trinity's landmark hotel, the restaurant is modern and fairly relaxed.

My girlfriend and I went for the lengthiest of the two tasting menus which was composed of 9 different dishes. The experience starts with some amuse-bouches and goes through different vegetarian, fish and meat dishes. The flavours and techniques used are combining French, Italian and Asian inspiration, making you discover new tastes and enjoyable combinations which made this dinner a real culinary experience.

As in many modern fine dining restaurants the menu tends to evolve towards fish and vegetarian ingredients reserving meat for usually one single dish. In the case of La Dame de Pic, another meat dish would have been welcomed given the high quality of the venison one.

The white millefeuille was delicious, yet the birthday-special apple pie was rather average.

A great experience as such but a little extra was missing to ensure our second visit",0
788,"What is there to say that hasn‚Äôt already been said? Just a life changing experience, the tasting menu is a must, and every single dish is so perfectly curated and executed. The staff is wonderful and the wine was excellent. I‚Äôm very fortunate that I‚Äôve had the opportunity to eat quite well in my life, but this meal was something particularly special. If you‚Äôre in the Basque Country you have to take advantage of the opportunity to sample some of the Michelin starred restaurants, and Arzak should be at the top of your list.",0
636,Was not disappointed with our second visit after so many years.,0
927,"Fresh off the high of excellent fine dining in Barcelona (Disfrutar, Tickets, Enigma), I was looking forward to my first three Michelin star experience in Spain. Not only does Arzak have three stars, it‚Äôs one of the rare World's 50 Best Restaurants to be headed by a female chef (no. 31 of 50). I even skipped Mugaritz (no. 9) the day before to give my stomach a break and fully appreciate the tasting menu at Arzak.

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with my lunch tasting menu experience. The food was fine, but not amazing - I enjoyed the small plates and desserts much more than the main courses which felt too flashy, yet uninspired and dated. A course came out on a color-changing tablet - money that could have been better spent on say, nicer wine glasses instead of their clunky ones.

What really let me down though were the sexist undertones. The sexism of the restaurant industry and general condoning of abusive behavior is no secret, but this was the first time I've actually felt uncomfortable as a diner at a fine dining establishment.

In contrast to confident females that were our primary servers at the other aforementioned restaurants, the female staff here seemed relegated to second-class citizens. They barely made eye contact or spoke, only serving to fold napkins with spoons (no hands allowed) and clear plates. A female stage chef hinted at her unhappiness and how she needed to think carefully about where to continue her career.

As for myself, I also experienced some interesting moments. I was taking notes in a small notebook, and the male ma√Ætre d' asked my husband if he were a chef. Now it isn't a huge leap to see a diner take handwritten notes and assume they work in the industry, but I was the one taking notes here, not my husband. I guess I was the secretary?

Throughout the meal, the same ma√Ætre d' was very alpha in his mannerisms. When I didn't finish the overcooked monkfish, he absolutely insisted I have another fish course. He was so confident I would eventually find one I liked.

After the multi-fish course ordeal, came the pigeon nonsense. When ordering, I said I wasn't a fan of pigeon, but the ma√Ætre d' asserted that the pigeon was their star dish, so I got pigeon as my second main course. The female server that cleared my plate showed the nearly untouched remains to the ma√Ætre d'. Of course he then came over and wanted me to have another course, but this time I had enough and didn't give in.

Right after this, Juan Mari Arzak (joint head chef with his daughter Elena) came over to greet the table, and Mr. Ma√Ætre d' whispered into his ear (in front of us and twice!) about the pigeon. Juan didn't seem disappointed by that though, he was too busy calling me ""nice"" and pinching my cheek - yes he actually pinched my cheek! Elena, who I actually wanted to meet, was out of town.

After this experience and the forgettable food, I can't recommend Arzak. For other fine dining in San Sebastian, Asador Etxebarri is at the top of my must-try list. It's about an hour outside of the city and has nothing but rave reviews from everyone I've talked to personally, including the head chef at Enigma. My husband also enjoyed his solo experience at Mugaritz the day before.",1
98,"We had the pleasure of eating here for lunch on the weekend and it was incredible! One of the best meals I've ever eaten, every detail was superb. I especially enjoyed Les Berlingots, and can see why it's a signature dish. The pork was perfection too!
All the staff were excellent, and very welcoming, which really added to the experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you Chef Lopez and team!",0

510,I came here for my wives birthday and got the taster menu. This has to be one of the best meals i have ever had. Because it was her birthday we got a free course and were taken down to meet the chef and given a loaf of bread to take home!,0
998,"It is a 3 Michelin star restaurant for a reason. The service is spectacular, the food is very very delicious, some dishes on the tasting menu are surprising but the final feeling is like something is missing for the price it is (very high, you can see it on the website). I left the restaurant, not hungry, but with the feeling that I could have eaten more. A lot more. The truth is that they give options to change dishes depending on tastes or allergies so it is flexible but for my taste there are not enough dishes, in other restaurants of this type they are more numerous and substantial.
Still spectacular.",0
434,This place is so heartwarming with a great hospitality and delicious dishes. Highly recommended!,0
214,"My wife and I had the most wonderful and memorable meal here last night. We really couldn't fault anything- service, attention to detail , and most importantly the food!. Highest compliments to the chef and the team here who treated us superbly. They deserve more than a Michelin star for what they have set out and created here. We had some dietary requirements which was accommodated so so well. Very impressed and for sure our new favourite restaurant in London. Cannot wait to come back. ü§óü•á",0

We had the vegetarian tasting menu (with one course modified for me since I don't like beets) along with the paired wines.

The food was great. The wines were a treat and matched each course perfectly. The staff was fabulous. The meal was an amazing experience that served as an exclamation point on our adventure in Europe.

We particularly enjoyed the very creative vegetarian courses. All were delicious and beautifully presented.

The meal was not inexpensive, but worth every penny! We are looking forward to the time when we can visit again.",0

The atmosphere is a bit more relaxed than other 2* Michelin restaurants and have to say, the quality of the food is up there with 3* restaurants such as Alain Ducasse and Gordon Ramsay.

Definitely dining there again.",0
