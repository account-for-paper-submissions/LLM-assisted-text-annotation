review
"***A dining experience that takes you around the world***
The chef, inspired by traveling to various destinations around the world creates dishes centered around a key ingredient from the that country. The meal was very innovative and bold in flavors.

The service staff were very attentive and friendly. The restaurant is a large open space with comfortable seating and a lovely view. I would gladly come to make a visit again.

"Diner at Ciel Bleu is a truly fantastic experience.
Located on the 23rd floor of Hotel Okura, Ciel Bleu offers an amazing dining experience, supplemented by an exceptional view over Amsterdam.

From entering the restaurant and throughout the evening, Ciel Bleu staff is there to comfort your every need. Service is exceptional, as can be expected from a restaurant operating at 2-star level for over 15 years. Timings of the dishes is aligned, wine is presented at the right time, everything is orchestrated just flawlessly.

The ambiance is comfortable, grey and white tones with thought-out lighting. Seats are very pleasant, and the way the tables and seats are arranged offers a great deal of privacy. For the view, try arranging a window seat, it is worth it.

Food is of the highest standard. Combination of flavours is complex but balanced. A few photos are attached, though they hardly do the dishes justice. All dishes are presented well, and the wine pairing lifts them to the next level. Personal highlights were the Seabass and A5 Wagyu beef, along with the chocolate dessert.

Fully recommend Ciel Bleu for an unforgettable gastronomic experience. The food, service and setting are simply top notch."
"Amazing experience.

Many thanks to the  Ciel Bleu staff for helping me set up the proposal, it was such a memorable moment that we will not forget.

Food is amazing, great attention to detail and staff is very caring and orgazined."
"Fantastic experience! I booked a dinner here for my fiancé’s birthday and I had the best meal in my life. Everything top quality, from the food to the staff. We were guided into the dishes and their ingredients, creating a unique moment."
"@ciel_bleu_restaurant Perched on the 23rd floor of@hotel_okura_amsterdam French restaurant with two Michelin stars in #amsterdam Most memorable for me was the tuna tartare served in the spine of the tuna!!!
Imaginative and creative. One of the best tuna tartare l've had. Also, the venison was outstanding. The chocolate desert was dressed like a crown of thorns. Service was friendly and professional without overbearing. Truly a bucket list culinary destination."
"Good experience and the food is amazing. From the restaurant you have a great view over Amsterdam, especially on a summer evening in June when the sun is setting late.

I was sitting at a table next to the window and the sun was shining into our eyes. We asked the staff if they could close the ‘Luxaflex blinds’, but we were told they couldn’t because other guests would not enjoy the view any more.

The blinds were only half way down and closing that part would certainly have solved this. Apart from this, the staff was very attentive and friendly."
"This restaurant provides great views of Amsterdam from the 23rd floor of the hotel building within which it resides. Try to book for their opening time slot and request for window-side seats and you won't be disappointed.

On top of the great views, the service really delivered. Everyone was friendly and attentive. We felt really welcomed and cared for. They picked up on little details and even offered to slow down the pace, which was a great gesture.

The Experience Menu is A LOT of food. As you can see in the photos, there were FOUR seafood courses after TWO smaller seafood courses. That's a lot of seafood. I personally felt that it was a bit too much, and the case may be the same for you. Because it's a lot of food, the whole meal took more than 4 hours.

Luckily, they offer a shorter menu at a discounted price. I'd definitely recommend the shorter menu.

Every course was very tasty and beautifully presented. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal. However, the bill included things like 10 euros for a small cup of coffee and 24 euros for water service. (or was it waiter service? don't remember). I did not like these ""fluff"" charges as the prix fixe costs were high to begin with.

If it were not for these charges I considered nickel-and-diming, I would've given 5 stars."
"Not usually one to leave uniformly good reviews, I have to confess this is truly one of the world’s best restaurants, the service is of unprecedented quality, with a highly dedicated authentically friendly and welcome team. A team approach, not just a single waiter, means you get to enjoy the synchrony of multiple waiters arriving at the same instant and placing all dishes for all guests on the twble in perfect coordination. A basic menu excluding wine is €215, so be prepared to splurge for this experience, but the taste and service will leave a permanent and indelible mark.

Points for improvement: none. Sit back and be transformed by the food, service and best view in Amsterdam"
"Dated ambience, muted flavors, uninspiring.  Great wine choices. Nice view of you get the right table. 4 hours for the shorter menu."
"Located on the 23rd floor of the Okura Hotel (where we were staying) Ciel Bleu is a rather classic but nonetheless amazing fine dining restaurant with a beautiful view on Amsterdam. I found the ambience definitely less formal then expected (positive not for me) mostly because of the great job of the waiters.
We opted for the season menu with the modern wine pairing and were definitely satisfied with the quality and quantity of what we had. Everything is balanced, perfectly executed and made with the finest ingredients.
As a little extra you can end the night in the lounge, absolutely recommended."
"Excellent experience! Every course was an explosion of flavors. The service was beyond excellent. Best views of the city.
A birthday dinner we won’t ever forget!"
"I went to this fine dining restaurant with my partner on Christmas Day. The have prepared a special menu for this special day. Every dish they prepared was impressive. No only they brought delicacy and perfection to every dish but the whole combination of dishes was also superb. Well done, Ciel Bleu."
"The caviar and Wagyu beef creations transported us to another realm, while the service was a symphony of knowledge, kindness, organization and attentiveness. An exceptional 2 Michelin star dining odyssey that will for sure linger in our memories!"
"The food was quite exquisite and well balanced, although I found the sauce on the two fish and venison main dishes a bit too heavily salted for my liking.

Service was excellent, the staff were incredibly attentive and a  special thanks to Noel the sommelier who was exceptionally knowledgeable, cheerful and friendly and this made the wine pairings a sensational experience."
"The visit to Ciel Bleu started very well.
We were quickly taken up to the restaurant where we got to sit in the lounge and enjoy excellent food and view for a few minutes.

After being taken to our table started we on a very exciting food journey that took us all over the world.
The dishes was creative and very tasteful.

The only negative part of the visit was that the service was lacking in the second half of our meal.
It felt like that they were a server too few."
"Ciel Bleu is truly one of the most outstanding restaurants I've ever had the pleasure to dine at. My partner and I had the 'Guestronomy' taster menu for my 32nd birthday this week and it certainly went down a treat.

The service was perfect, the food was perfect, the view was perfect, everything was absolutely perfect! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough and will almost certainly be back again in the future.

Special thanks to Jane and Mandy from the floor staff and chef Arjan Speelman who went to every effort to make it the great experience that it was. Many thanks in addition for the very kind signed menu!"
"This place is deserving of 3 Michelin stars, not just two. Ciel Bleu is the best restaurant I have ever dined at. Everything fell into place: each dish of the tasting menu was out of this world, the service was friendly and flawless, the wine pairings delectable, and ambiance perfect. Thank you for a memorable dining experience and I can't wait to come back again!"
"Exceptional **Michelin restaurant. Service and presentation deserving of a 3rd star.  It is located on the top floor of a hotel so it has a wonderful view. Degustation menu options, with full wine pairing option available. Fresh ingredients and delicious. Overall a wonderful experience."
"Pretty nice Michelin star restaurant with the view. Everything was on the level: food and wine pairing, service. For myself it wasn’t something remarkable. Thank you"
"I’ve never spent so much money to feel hungry.

The view is great, the service is great, and the presentation is fantastic. The bread, handmade butter, and desert, were fantastic.

But beyond that there was a lot more show in this place than substance. 3 of the 5 courses were not tasty to me. I left feeling hungry.

Paying this much for a meal was a significant splurge for us, far beyond what we’ve ever paid, and the food was not far beyond what we’ve ever experienced."
We had such a fantastic experience here. The food was amazing and the staff was wonderful. Fine dining really is about the experience as much as the food and this place delivered on both. There are also beautiful views of the city as you eat. I would say this restaurant is worth making a trip for even.
This was an unforgettable experience! Still remember the chick and the taste! Very nice!
"Very nice restaurant of French cuisine with Japanese touch with a great view on Amsterdam. While reservation we mentioned that it was my boyfriend’s dad 70th Birthday night out, but unfortunately we didn’t even get table near the window with a great view. The food was really great all the bites and seafood dishes were amazing, bread with different types of butter is excellent. Duck was good, but nothing mind blowing, wagyu was good, but unfortunately not a ribeye or sirloin cut. Pre-dessert was great, great idea of presentation of freshly made nougat. Desert was refreshing, but nothing special. Good experience, very nice and friendly staff, but didn’t live up to our expectations!"
Extraordinary experience. Sophisticated and professional by all means. Deserves the 2 Michelin stars to the fullest.
I've waited 8 months to book this experience and wow it was like a dream. 5 courses of heaven and the staff and chefs are the nicest I've ever met. Pure happiness the whole three hours.
"Just don't go, it's not worth the money. When we went the only options available were Waegu Beef (for an extra €250+) or pigeon. We chose the pigeon, not truly thinking we would see it's relatives for the rest of the trip. One of the courses was butter... Yep you read it right 🍞 and butter. Unfortunately, that would end up the second best dish of all the courses. The seafood sashimi salad was flavorless and lacked anything on the plate to break up the mushy consistency (and I'm a sashimi lover). The best dish was the sea bass. The broth surrounding it was phenomenal, and it's texture was supple. It was perfectly cooked. The pigeon...well it tasted like - go outside, look at a pigeon... Yep it tastes like that. The pastry chef saved the meal, though with a beautiful chocolate pastry. The view is stunning and the staff attentive. We were so ready to love the restaurant. The food just disappointed."
"Had dinner with friend yesterday,  the food was no question good, service was also very nice, but after we paid bill, my friend found out the total amount i have paid was wrong,  I over paid 120 euros. We reported this to the employee,  he told us it's a system mistake,  and he's not in charge of it, none was standing out to take the responsibility.  In the end I got 120 euro refunded in cash, a candle and some home fragrance as a free birthday gift.
It is really weird because the items we ordered on the bill is 100% correct,  but if you add all the prices together, the total amount is wrong 😑
It's a good restaurant, such a disappointment with the payment system.  Hope it's not gonna happen again."
"All in all it was a great evening. Got to see the sunset during the meal and nice concept with all the different spices around the world. There were several dishes though that were overly salted and I thought three courses of dessert was a bit heavy. I would’ve been happy with only the first one, with the nice clean citrusy note to end the evening. Just my two cents."
"For many many  years we enjoy our visits to the various restaurants in the Okura Hotel.. our Christmas day dinner at the Ciel Blue was a highlight… The excellent dishes with creative presentation and exquisite saveur as also the professional service with a smile made iur evening memorable…
The two-star Michellin rating was justified!"
"The service was second to none. Not to mention the restaurant has a great view of the city.
Some staff might have language barrier (we spoke English) but it’s not a big concern."
"Amazing food, really in a special way prepared.  The waiters know so much about all the wines and dishes and they  just tell you in such a nice way...loved it! Worth every cent."
"Good restaurant, but the service died when we started with desserts (no more water, had to ask for the bill...)

Bread and butter was excellent.

The chocolate dessert was way to powerful."
This is an amazing experience! I would say the best I've add so far! The balance of all flavor's are impacable. I felt full at the end and didn't have the need to stop somewhere to grab a burger. The wine pairing experience is perfect and the staff are on top. Thanks again!!!
"At the top floor of the 5* Okura Hotel Amsterdam you'll enjoy an amazing experience at Ciel Bleu. Seated in a beautiful decor of gentle black, soft grey and the natural touch of the Dutch Birch, the skyline of the Dutch Capital is your scenery. Fine Dining in Holland in a sophisticated and still extraordinary hospitable and friendly way. Two Michelin Star Chef Onno Kokmeijer and his Crew will take you on a Culinary Experience you'll remember for the rest of your life."
"The food was beyond ""just"" a two star restaurant. For me, its the perfect balance between hand crafted and affordable food. The service was incredibly nice. Our glasses of water were never empty (literally!!).

We spent approx 2 1/2 hours there and it was the perfect way to finish our long day. We didnt drink any whine so I cannot judge that, however, from what I've noticed is that the people responsible for the whine did an amazing job on not only suggesting good whine, but also taking great care and time into explaining each individual whine to every guest.

not gonna lie, I will return. Its 100% worth it."
Wonderful restaurant with great service. They make everything very personal and you feel very welcomed. A must I'd you are visiting Amsterdam!
"One of the best u can find around Europe when it comes to service. (Hotel de Paris Monaco level) but it’s in Amsterdam. Once u r out of the restaurant, u r back to reality."
"An incredible experience.  Absolutely worth a visit.  Describing the dishes is pointless, you have to check it out yourself!"
"It's a good place to dine, good food, good service and good produce. It's a place to go once, but maybe that's about it. There's better offers in Amsterdan for the same price and quality."
"Best service I have received compared to other fine dining place! Staff are attentive, professional and knowledgable in their offered food and drinks. Foods are good in general - except one dish with langoustine which is a bit too salty to my taste. I passed this comment to the chef and interestingly his excuse is ‘usually Asian people eat less salt than others’ and it is the reason why I did not enjoy it?! (If so, how could I still enjoy other dishes!!). I dont think he means anything else by this answer, but blaming on clients’ taste rather than openly receiving their feedback is not the attitude I would expect from a two michelin star chef."
Top 2 stars Michelin restaurant in Amsterdam with an unparalleled flawless service level that I had not experienced in other top restaurants in Amsterdam.
"Deserves their Michelin stars. Great service, great luxurious experience. The sommelier last night (Oct 4, 2023) was fantastic, BTW."
"An amazing michelin star experience with amazing food, fantastic service and awesome view !!!"
"Overall very good service and the food was spectacular, but the manager there was exceptionally unprofessional. We accumulated a decent bill over the course of the night and the manager came over to swipe my card. He made a joke stating “I’m surprised your card went through, I guess you won’t have to be washing dishes in the back.” I laughed it off but it was uniquely awkward. He should be talked to about his pompous behavior in the future. Besides that, yes the food is top notch and the rest of the team did well in serving my friend and I."
Ciel Bleu has definitely earned their two michelin stars! The food and service were both incredible and at the end of the meal the waiter even asked if i would like to see the kitchen. While in the kitchen the chef even came over and talked to me for a minute! Definitely an experience to remember
Amazing meal with an equally amazing view. Other food in Amsterdam simply does not compare.
Greatest evening ever... special Thanks to the Sommelier  and the Maître... it was a pleasure to be there
"Delicious, balanced taste. Not cheap (you can go on a small holiday from this) but one of the best meals I ever had! You close your eyes if you taste this. Although this establishment might seem a bit chique/stuck-up (has been around for lots of years), the staff is really nice and you get great views also."
"It was a bit sad. Some dishes were nice (the caviar and blini, the crab, the langoustine) but desert was overpoweringly sweet. Not sure about the spice journey… 4 out of 6 slots got filled… none of the spices was that noticeable in the dish, so why bother. Wine pairing was ok except for the rather uninspired sweet wines for desert. Service seemed confused and often it felt like nobody was paying attention although a lot of waiters were moving around. Sitting in front of our empty dishes for way too long. Getting desert seemed to drag out for ever. There is also a fine line between old school fine dining service and arrogance. I can not recommend."
"The seasonal menu was quite entertaining where each course was proceeded with the introduction of a spice, which we could smell before tasting our food. Some of the staff had rather strong Italian accents, which is charming as always, but please speak a bit slower so we may fully appreciate the interesting stories you are telling.

Dishes were works of art with highest quality ingredients. Scallops were my favourite. The caviar menu had interesting pairings and was especially surprising in the dessert course.

The head waiter was extremely kind to adjust the tables when I asked to give me the window table instead. There is an unfortunate rule that each table has to choose the same menu, which is really unpleasant and draconian. I understand it might be a bit more work, but there were more than 10 tables that night, surely both menus were being prepared at the same time. For a Michelin restaurant, the logistics should not be the reason to limit guests' dining choice. Our headwaiter had to ask special permission from the chef to accommodate us having both menus.

I was quite embarrassed that my guest (the wife of my former boss) was required to remove her baker boy cap, which is not a baseball cap and has a very small brim that does not cover the face. We were told it was for security reasons. This is the first time I have ever heard such a rule and is especially ridiculous at a Michelin restaurant. I imagine terrorists do not sit down for a fancy meal before carrying out atrocities. Anyway there should be some leeway to just show one's face to whatever surveillance camera and then be allowed to wear it again, but my guest was not allowed. You can just tell this was a rule made by a man. Please consider sometimes women have legitimate reasons for wanting to cover their heads, hair loss from illness or chemo for example. So much effort goes into impeccable service, but all that can be defeated with inconsiderations such as this.

I quite liked the fact that some of the service staff were women. When they serve our table, it is far less oppressive than having four tall black suited men towering above us. It's one of those relics from traditional fine dining traditions that should be updated for better guest experience."
"Great food experience, but overpriced. We both had the “experience” menu, and the dishes are indeed a wonderful experience. Each dish was unique and interesting, with complex choices of ingredients. The wine was good and complimented the meal beautifully. I have no complaints about the food. The service is decent, and the overall atmosphere is quite nice although not too special.

However, we both didn’t feel it was worth the 440eu we ended up paying (before tip).

I have been to around 5 two-star Michelin restaurants in my life, and this was probably the most expensive but least exciting of them."
"Really great experience and very nice staff. Just a small points from a personal view for improvement :
Please don't put thick sauce over a wagyu steak, better is it to serve it natural with just salt."
"Amazing menu, perfect service! It’s a must try, with wonderful Amsterdam view!"
"Gorgeous view. Pleasant setting. Very pricey.  Food is beautifully presented but unfortunately the flavors are not compelling
I would expect more wow on the palate at a Michelin two star, especially at these prices. You cannot order a la carte and the tasters menu starts at 195 euros without beverages."
"This restaurant gives you a high-end quality for a very reasonable price. Probably one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The staff was so pleasant, and so engaging. The food was excellent, each course was well laid out. We had a 8 course meal for about 250 each. Could not have asked for a better meal. And if you're lucky enough to get a table near the window you have an excellent view of Amsterdam. Well done chef!"
"INCREDIBLE MEAL! My partner and I went here for dinner and had the gastronomy menu and it was to die for! The timing of the food, the wine pairing, the ambiance, everything was phenomenal. We’ve eaten at many Michelin star restaurants and this was definitely a top experience."
"Extraordinary experience in cuisine as well as service. The joy of tasting a variety of dishes with flavor combinations very new and so exquisite, leaves us very satisfied. Service was also equally high to accompany the high level of culinary delight."
"Incredible delicious Menu (Guestronomy).
I asked them to surprise me with wine's.
Well, they managed. Very good choices.
YES, it is expensive but for us it was a wonderful evening."
"Overpriced , but yeah okay you pay for the experience eating in a 2* Michellin restaurant in Okura hotel in Amsterdam.. I enjoyed the Wyagu beef, the wine arrangement (not all were my favourite) and the selection of butter. This really filled my stomach so we skipped the cheese selection in the end. We got a second dessert and after a lot of chocolate bonbons (sugar overload, way too much).The tea experience was a bit a dissapointment, next too the hot water too much cold water was poured by the waitress. Overall it was a nice experience but not sure if I would recommend it."
"Mind blowing culinary experience! Each dish here is a piece of art. Service, wine pairing, drinks and the view: all wonderful.  It is quite pricy but worth for an extraordinary experience. Michellin 2 star is very well deserved."
"I have been to many michelin star restaurants but this is one of the best restaurants I have eaten in a while, no doubt about it! The food was amazing and the service even better. The wine was very tasty, matched the dishes and the explenations by sommelier Job were very good and clear. Fabienne explained the diches perfectly. A very special thanks to Pasquinel who gave as a warm welcome at the restaurant and excellent service during the whole evening. Time flew us by and the great service kept a smile on our faces during the whole dinner :).  Thank you so much team Okura for a evening we will treasure!"
"Wonderful experience, excellent service and clear, open, well presented information by all staff. Really enjoyed it. Well done."
"I was offended by how I was treated in this expensive canteen. The waiters think they are playing a role in a comedy and do not really care about the customers.

At the end of the dinner one of the waiters explicitly asked me for a tip. This had never happened to me before in my whole life. I felt like I was dealing with homeless people and not with who should supposedly be a high class waiter.

I was offered a coffee or a digestive but this was added to the bill. This was also new to me. All the times I was offered a coffee or a digestive in a restaurant/pizzeria/trattoria/service station, it was ALWAYS ON THE HOUSE. This should be a friendly way to express gratitude to a customer, to make them feel at home. I didn't express this to happen in a restaurant like this.

The food is poor and without taste. I don't know where they found some ingredients but I think they should not even be used for cooking.

All in all, this place absolutely does not the high performance expectations that a 2 michelin star restaurant should guarantee.

All in all, this restaurant does not meet the high perfom"
"Truly lives upto its michelin stars. It's one of the best places in Amsterdam for a great dinner, amazing service and beautiful view of the city. The caviar is one of the specials of the place - make sure you try it out whilst there.
There was so much of good stuff here - it's difficult to break it down. All I can say is that we spent 5 hours for our dinner and it was special in every which way - food, service, ambience and view."
Good food. Great staff. Bit over priced but have great view of the city. Thank you.
They are good  but not up to my expectation as a two stars Michelin ranking. Wine pairing is not stunning  but the Sommelier can explain the wine great details . Overall is good and fine but not as authentic  as the the best food ought to be.
The restaurant had OK food in extremely small portions. The bread was tasty but I've had better. It's an extremely fancy restaurant with extremely high prices with just OK food. Trust me - you can eat better food in much larger portions for one fifth of the price..
"Extremely pleased with everything - seating, view, staff, food. Absolutely brilliant! It lives up to the expectations, and even surpasses them. The thing that caught my attention is that even though it is an upscale restaurant, the staff were quite friendly, relaxed, and even witty, which was unexpected."
"The bread was good :)
Without it we would have stayed hungry.
Very small portions, kind of tastings, which can not be said about their prices.
Some of the tastings were really good, the rest were mediocre."
"I'm going to be picky here, because for a restaurant with 2 Michelin stars and the price tag which comes with that designation, things should be flawless and I should be blown away. They weren't, and I wasn't.

The service:
- Our napkins were placed incorrectly into our laps (crease facing my knees instead of my torso)
- Despite the restaurant being nearly empty on a Monday night our empty/dirty plates sat in front of us for up to several minutes instead of being picked up right away once we were done with each course.
- Crumbly bread was served, which inevitably led to crumbs on the table. These were only cleaned away between the main course and the dessert. I had to pick crumbs off the table myself.
- Before the main course was served we were asked if we wanted a rest period. We asked for a 5 minute break. 15 minutes later and our duck was nowhere to be found. I had to call one of the servers to ask about it's whereabouts. Received no apology on the delay.

The food:
- Several of the savory courses were overly salty. This is a sin in a place where you should be tasting the goodness of the seasonal ingredients.
- The pre-dessert was sorbet, fruit, and meringue served on a thin rice paper. The server took time to explain that we should roll the ingredients inside the rice paper, like an Amsterdam rolled cigarette. This was a bit gimmicky but cute and I was excited to do so. But the paper didn't actually roll. It was brittle and barely had any give as I tried to fold it awkwardly to fit the thing in my mouth. It crumbled around me as a took a bite.
- Since it was our anniversary they gifted us an extra treat for dessert... apple pie. This was a very nice gesture. However, while it was beautiful with gold leaf and all, the crust was hard and tasteless. I have sincerely had better apple pie from Albert Heijn.

Overall I was disappointed with our experience. I doubt that we'll ever return."
"Want to experience something really special? For let's say an anniversary or any other sort of celebration? Eat here. This is amazing. Unparalleled. The food is F A N T A S T I C, French cuisine with a hint of the orient, super creative, amazing flavours, your tastebuds will go crazy, this is heaven! And staff? I never ever experienced so much dedication and pampering before. And I am spoiled! These people -all white gloves on- will make you feel very very special. One person will remove crumbs from your tablecloth, another will place the plates and necessary 'tools', another will serve you the food and of course their sommelier wil poor you the excellent wines and -yes- another member of the staff will tell you all about what's in front of you, looking like a masterpiece, waiting to be enjoyed by you, bringing bliss to the parts of your brain where flavours are processed. And then the venue itself, it has amazing views over Amsterdam, being on the 23rd floor of the Okura hotel, it all adds up to the heavenly experience of visiting this 2 stars Michelin restaurant. Try before you die!"
Fantastic views over Amsterdam. Food menu was amazing with the best wine selection I've ever had. Overall it may be expensive but totally worth it.
"The price quality ratio is at Ciel Bleu better as restaurants like Librije's Zusje or Bord'eau.
Chef's specialty is a must. Do try the Ciel Blue beer, since most michelinstar restaurants lack a good choice of beer. There are a few dishes that really fit this (ask the service if not told). I personally love the selection of cheese. Would recommend."
The place and Staff are awesome! I have never had this Kind of threatment. The food was really good and they gave us a tour in the kitchen after the sitting. Best place ever!
Good food. Great creative menu. Great staff. Great view of the city from the 23rd floor. Bit over priced. Overall a great experience. Thank you.
5+ ⭐️ Excellent menu and amazing gastronomic creations; unbeatable view and very elegant atmosphere. Each of the stuff members made by Bday celebration truly unforgettable. Thank you 👍🏻 …
"I was a little disappointed with the food. I expected more fore the price.
The ambience, the view and the service were great. But that does not help if you come for the food."
Very good restaurant with top notch service. Food is of the highest quality. Views from the 23th floor over Amsterdam are amazing. Definitely would recommend booking a room in the Okura hotel combined with a dinner at Ciel Bleu.
"Excellent flavours, textures and combinations throughout the tasting menu. Smooth friendly service complements a great meal."
"Wonderful staff, relaxing environment, wonderful selections, and amazing food. 10/10 So far, the best dining experience I've had."
"Fine dining with a beautiful view of the Amsterdam skyline. Service is top notch and food is surprising, in a good way."
"Excellent food, excellent service and excellent setting. Five stars, it was a wonderful experience."
Nothing to complain about. This was again a mega experience ... Staff really has all the knowledge and brings it to the table in a very nice way. Highly recommended!
"Best gastronomical moment of my life, great staff, perfection was in every dish, worth every penny. Thanks so much to everyone, it was magical."
Food and service are excellent. Had the paired wine taster menu and loved each component.
"very good michelin starred restaurant with an amazing view of Amsterdam, we enjoyed our culinary evening. Thank you"
"Staff is nice, friendly and humourous. We like everything of the menu."
Excellent fine dining experience with a wonderful view from the top off the Amsterdam Okura hotel 👌 …
The food good. But the service was way too slow. Not recommended unless you have 6 hours
"Great service, signature dishes are a perfect combination of flavor, texture, and presentation."
"Great food and wine experience, mostly local and organic ingredients."
service and food are perfect. i've been there several times and will be back for sure.
It was 4 hours of pure happyness. Everything was perfect.
"This place just finish renovated 2 weeks ago the embiance better than before, also they has very good food, can't say much , must trying all of you 🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒 …"
"***The best representation of what fine dining should be***
I have been to many fine dining restaurants that put an emphasis on how the food is plated. But very few can make their food taste as good as it looks. Food at La Dame de Pic is plated beautifully and tastes even better than it looks. I am not surprised there are multiple locations now.

After eating this meal I will try to look out for other Sophie Pic restaurants.

The service and atmosphere was also impeccable."
"I must say, the culinary experience at this restaurant is truly exceptional. Every dish we tried was executed to perfection, and the presentation of each plate was simply stunning. We thoroughly enjoyed the wine pairing, and the non-alcoholic pairing offered a refreshing and delightful alternative.

However, while the food and drink were outstanding, the ambiance fell short of the high standards one might expect from a Michelin 2-star establishment. The atmosphere felt rather casual and lacked the unique flair that sets top-tier dining experiences apart. It seemed like we could have been dining anywhere else in London. Overall, a fantastic culinary journey, though the ambiance didn’t quite match the excellence of the cuisine"
"Great night out à la Dame de Pic.

Food was amazing, flavour well balanced. Les Berlingots is a must try, an explosion of flavour. My other favourite were the Jerusalem Artichokes

Given the location, atmosphere did not felt too pompous, thanks to the friendly staff and their attention to details"
"A fantastic experience. The tasting menu takes you on a marvelous ride along a road full of flavor and texture. Every single plate and bite was enjoyable and memorable.
The place has a refined taste, and they take care of every tiny aspect so you get the best time. The best moment of the evening was when the chef López came to introduce himself to the table and asked us to go with him and meet the kitchen and the staff behind the curtains.
All that you could expect from a two-star Michelin Restaurant you will find it here."
"We had the pleasure of eating here for lunch on the weekend and it was incredible! One of the best meals I've ever eaten, every detail was superb. I especially enjoyed Les Berlingots, and can see why it's a signature dish. The pork was perfection too!
All the staff were excellent, and very welcoming, which really added to the experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you Chef Lopez and team!"
"La Dame de Pic, c’est fantastique ! I thought the lunch was pretty exceptional. We went for the Découverte menu (6 dishes) and don’t think we could have eaten more as we were really full. Each dish was beautifully presented and had incredible flavours. The staff was really friendly and attentive, catering to our dietary requirements and even celebrated my friend’s birthday with a nice card and cake. I particularly loved the Berlingots and the South Lanarkshire Tinto Cheese. My least favourite dish was the mallard but I still ate it all! I cannot fault it otherwise. Well done, Chef!"
"What a dream to visit this beautiful restaurant. Fantastic attentive service, delicious, creative & perfectly executed food, plus an elegant setting.
By far one of the best fine dining experiences in London, highly recommend."
"🌟🌟 La dame de Pic London 2 Michelin star restaurant.  ​🍽 Recommendation:​ Set menu 5 courses.  The desserts are amazing!!!  The other main dish really impress me is the turbot. The rest of the cuisines are very French but kind of push it too hard.  💁 Service:​ Good but not enough. Don’t pay attention to details.  💰 £200- £500 per person​, depending on the drinks.  📍 Location: ​ located in four season the city, typical for a Michelin star restaurant. Easy to find and very suitable for celebrating birthday and business meetings."
"We have been to La Dame de Pic a few times when they had only a star and it always have been one of our favorite place to have lunch. We are back for lunch today and the cooking was beat our expectations, honestly better than the other 2 female chefs who has 3 stars in London. We had the journey menu, and it was the perfect quantity for lunch. My favorite dish was the whiskey soaked tomato and the cured sweetbread before was very innovative!
We also thought it was very nice for the restaurant to allow free corkage up to a bottle to let fine dining become more accessible to younger people"
"Walked in for lunch. It is located in Four Season Hotel Trinity Square next to tower bridge. Very high ceiling and high end decorated.
The dining atmosphere is very formal and the space between tables is big.
The service is professional and efficient.
The plating of all dishes is obsoletely beautiful. The taste of the food is complex but well balanced. I like all the dishes. Enjoyed my lunch very much."
"Food and service were impeccable.

Asked for a last minute kitchen tour and full kitchen signed our menu without hesitation.

Our server Trey was hilarious, informative and fantastic throughout the entire evening. I would go back solely to have him as our waiter again. Thank you Trey!

One of London’s ever amazing restaurants- will be returning when they get their (very likely) third star.

Don’t miss it."
"Absolutely loved our lunch there. I've done a few of the 3 Michelin stars in London and I think La Dame de Pic is as good as those (if not better than some of them) even though it is a 2 stars. The whole experience was a delight from taste to presentation, including a very attentive service and a lovely setting/atmosphere."
"Fantastic food and friendly service, expect nothing less from a Michelin starred restaurant and such an accomplished chef. Loved the Japanese inspired adaptiations to traditional French cuisine. Would come back here for future celebrations!"
"I so wanted to give this full marks, as we had very high expectation for a 2 star restaurant.

Sadly, I have to mark it down for one fundamental failure.

We opted for the Journey tasting menu with pairing (@ £120 per person), which they delivered by the chef with each dish. HOWEVER, the timings  and delivery of each pairing was wrong, and it ruined the experience of each dish ( which is the point of paring option). The pairings were served 10-15 mins before each course, and with many of the pairings needing to be serviced chilled, they were warm by the time the food arrived. This completely ruined our experience.

After getting the attention of our waiter, he continued to time his pour wrong.  Finally we spoke to one of the senior managers, who informed me that the kitchen failed to communicate with front of house, and offered our cocktails on the house as an apology.

Sadly, it doesn’t rectify the failure, and at a cost in excess of £600."
"Nice dinner at La Dame de Pic: good food, some interesting wines, good service. The millefeuille is remarkable, as are the crab tartelettes. We had the emotions wine pairing and while interesting, it was not mind blowing. Been to more memorable one and two star restaurants though."
"This was my third time eating here, having been totally blown away by the food on my first and second visits. And once again I left feeling the same this time.

Canapés were beautiful and delicious as always. The uniqueness of the vodka and cocoa butter canapé always amazes me. The bread was freshly baked, with a great consistency; crisp and hard on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Served with it was a terrific celeriac amuse-bouche. The mackerel was fresh and was enhanced further by the sweet and sour flavours of the vinaigrette. Anne Sophie Pic's signature pasta dish Les Berlingots was impressive as predicted, filled with a warm, rich, creamy cheese sauce, accompanied by a delicately sweet pea broth.

The lobster with monks beard had the perfect texture but I felt this dish was slightly ruined by the fact there was a very bitter sauce at the bottom, which I believe was made from Pomelo Hirado. Unfortunately, it was so bitter that it became dominant throughout. The monkfish meunière was excellent; the fish was cooked beautifully with the right level of seasoning, served alongside a selection of tender but crunchy vegetables. An ideal combination! The meat course consisted of guinea fowl with tonka. It was incredibly tender and soft. The tonka added a nice aroma to the dish, though the meat itself could have seen a little more seasoning, it was slightly bland. Nevertheless, this was one of the best guinea fowl dishes I have eaten, though I personally prefer other birds like duck and chicken.

The Gariguette strawberry dessert was a work of art and could not be more representative of the spring season; vibrant, refreshing, simple and light. Desserts here have always been a firm favourite of mine and continue to be, for good reason.

This was again a fabulous evening. The dishes were light and elegant, demonstrating Anne Sophie Pic's distinctive and creative cuisine. Many of the dishes had pleasant aromas, owing to the use of ingredients such as pepper and tea. La Dame de Pic continues to be one of my favourite restaurants and I always thoroughly look forward to dining here ;)

A fourth visit???....... Oh yes"
"What a place to eat!
The service was amazing with attentive and knowledgeable staff and they make you feel welcome and treasured.
The food is to just die for!  I’ve eaten many amazing meals but this is just spectacular… everything is a taste experience of such amazing ingredients that just work and the presentation of the food is sublime.
My favourite dishes were the signature dish of sea bass and caviar and the Scottish langoustine.
The cleverest dishes were the tiny tarts of turbot and pumpkin tarts as well as the cheese course. This was a cheese mousse with fig purée and a tiny, thin cracker on top just perfect. The wine pairing was needed to make this extra special and it was our anniversary and they brought out a special finishing touch . A perfect evening and worth every penny for such an incredible dining experience… thank you"
"Entering the restaurant was extremely grand. Service staff were extremely polite and attentive.

We selected the voyager tasting experience and were dissatisfied with the meal.

Execution and balance of the tasting menu was extremely disappointing. All the dishes were quite full flavoured and over powering …. it was too much on the palette. High recommend for slot in some lighter dishes to provide the palette a break ;-) Chef did use amazing ingredients were top notch and super fresh.

Scallop was best executed but over salted. Butter was just too experimental for me.

It’s a real shame ;-) don’t think we will be back again."
"A true fine dining experience in a stunning venue

Within the Four Season Trinity's landmark hotel, the restaurant is modern and fairly relaxed.

My girlfriend and I went for the lengthiest of the two tasting menus which was composed of 9 different dishes. The experience starts with some amuse-bouches and goes through different vegetarian, fish and meat dishes. The flavours and techniques used are combining French, Italian and Asian inspiration, making you discover new tastes and enjoyable combinations which made this dinner a real culinary experience.

As in many modern fine dining restaurants the menu tends to evolve towards fish and vegetarian ingredients reserving meat for usually one single dish. In the case of La Dame de Pic, another meat dish would have been welcomed given the high quality of the venison one.

The white millefeuille was delicious, yet the birthday-special apple pie was rather average.

A great experience as such but a little extra was missing to ensure our second visit"
This is a one time experience. I recommand the 3 hours journey with «  la dame de Pic ». Be ready for great food. The wine pairing is a good option for perfect matching. I hope I will have another opportunity to eat in this restaurant. The staff can speak French and other language to make you very comfortable.
"Despite seeing so many good reviews, I wasn’t too impress by the experience I had yesterday. I was expecting a bit more on the service for 2 michelin star restaurant but didn’t really meet my expectations compared to other 2-3 michelin restaurants I have been to in London. There were not many staffs around, bread crumbs were not clean on the course, napkins were not fold when left the table, water wasn’t refill when empty. I just felt the touch of personal service from the staff is missing and really needs improving. It might be different for other customers experience but certainly didn’t meet mine. Food presentation although quite good though not extraordinary. Flavours wise: I did find the pasta parcel cheese and pigeon were a bit salty to my taste. Monkfish was cooked perfection and goes well with the vegetables around. The one probably wow me the most is their signature dessert white millefuielle, the detail of the layers were cooked really beautifully.

Overall the tasting menu was good choice but really hoping they could put a bit more attention to their service. I really believe a michelin star restaurant need to tick all the boxes with the food, ambience and service. Hopefully the owner or manager reads this and come up with some improvement."
"La Dame de Pic in summary.

Wonderful food and impressive service from food staff.

Extremely odd drinks flight that seemed to be “out there” for no other reason than to be “out there”, many courses on the flight replaced with cocktails, shorts and spirits that did not pair well in my opinion with the dishes. I would say that considering the price point on the flights available, I would not recommend any flight and simply pair your courses as you go. I also found the sommeliers to be a little rude and carrying a certain obnoxious strain which was a little disappointing.

The atmosphere here is unfortunately odd. Mixture of high class and long forgotten tile work (this tile work is throughout the walls in the restaurant and resembling something you may see in a 90s gym changing room), it certainly was odd and very off putting. Some amends to the restaurant styling would make a huge impact to the overall experience.

A little underwhelming experience as a whole but the food was exceptional, I just couldn’t get over the wine service, the atmosphere and the styling, when you are paying top level, you do expect a little more refinement in the experience as a whole.

Would tentatively return but certainly without the “wine” flight and hopefully after some changes are made to dining room aesthetics."
"This restaurant is settled in the magnificent Four Seasons hotel. Great value lunch menu with good choices. The pairing wines were fantastic value and matched the courses perfectly. The food not only looked beautiful but was delicious, made with great love and a total understanding of flavour and textures.
The dining room with it's high ceilings and beautiful decor made this an incredible dining experience."
"La Dame de Pic is a 2 star Michelin restaurant located within the 4 Seasons Hotel.
Decor and service are exceptional. Our sommelier Gonzalo, was very knowledgable, ""give me your best bottle under 200"" , and he did not disappoint.
Food wise, we went for the voyage menu, as well as the cheese platter.
A few amuse-bouche came in, I saw a few complains, from one of it beeing to boozie. It had alcohol indeed but it's a palate cleanser. It was a lovely marriage of 2 maritime flavors and a touch of desert , that i think, intends to give you an overview of whats about to come. It's fresh, clean, not overpowering and care was given to maintain the original flavor of the protein (reminscent in some ways of Nouvelle Cuisine inspiration ).
Cornish Mackerel, treat, balanced . Lactic vinaigrette reduces the acidity of the ribbons.
Berlingots, cheezy, tangy, perfect match with the petit pois . Nettle coulis added a touch of bitterness to balance the sweetness of the petit pois.
White Asparagus, bang on with that after taste, again of cheese, iberico pork adding saltiness. The sabayon is indeed a very interesting addition as it adds a floral note to a strong dish, and by doing so complementing it on the side. It might not be to everybodys's taste, but it's unusally flavorfull.
The scottish lobster was my partners favorite. Perfectly cooked , the sealed bee wax that matures the lobsters gives some nuance with a perfect green tea tanin. Our waitress mentioned it was on a consomé, not at all. It was more on the bisque side (cloudy) , and was really good, touch of bitterness from cubes of pomelo.
Wild Seabass, I wouldn't dare to comment it. It's a signature dish for a reason, I'll leave it to surprise you.
Guinea Fowl was also exceptional, the perfume of the tonka that adds a caramely/cinnamony flavor to the palais is wow. Same goes for the pommes dauphines (filled with more mushrooms). Morels were the""oh no"" of the menu, not fresh ( I appreciate dehydrated mushrooms can be similar but still not the same), and far , far too salty (maybe the farce or the seasoning on top, hard to tell).
Desert, hands down, 3 stars. The gariguettes has that respect for the strawberry highlighting the fruity flavors. It wouldn't almost need that sweet tuile. Millefeuilles , indeed, star of the show.
Forgot to mention , cheese selection is cheap but not worth it .
Bottom line, @annesophie, fantastic staff, 2 stars well deserved. Thank you La Dame de Pic for a lovely lunch."
"Food service was extremely slow. It took 1.5h to get the first dish in a tasting course. It took good 40 mins between dishes and total of 4h for 8 course menu. Main was nice but some of the side on dish did not go well with the main, too polarising flavour."
"Great experience, 1 star knocked off for a dish that should not have left the kitchen. However, the response from the excellent staff was perfect. We would definitely return, for a 2 star restaurant we were made to feel at ease and the quality of the ingredients, cooking and service was top notch."
"Amazing!! Food was so delicious. Superb presentation. High cuisine techniques and flavour combinations. Incredible value for money - 3 dish set lunch at a 2 Michelin star restaurant in central London for £45 - an absolute bargain! Complementary starters (3 different bite size eats), complementary bread and flavoured butter, and complementary tarts. Super nice and profesional staff. Great ambience and lots of natural light and space. I cannot fault it. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would."
"Went for voyage menu for dinner. Starting nibbles are delicate and tasty. The menu itself is disappointing, either too strong or too salty, and even have shells in the crab dish, though presentation is of the standard. Dessert saves them all. I would go again if I can only order the desserts."
"We came here a while ago, been meaning to write this review!
One of the best restaurants I’ve been to.
Sea bass with caviar was amazing.
Interesting wine (or drink???) pairing that works!
Spotless service! Waiter gave us his ‘fav’ dessert on the house because it was a ‘must try’. (Huge plus as I’m a sucker for freebies!)
Perfect experience."
"Wonderful experience, attention is put on every detail, taste is wonderful, I was worried about the quantity at first, but you are given some extra that are not on the menu : like bouchées before the starters and also with the desert. We had the journey menu. I think the service was just too quick and I needed a bit more time between plates, I had to force myself a bit at the end because I'm not used to eat so much (but we stayed 2h in total, it's probably a me thing more than a real issue) and I couldn't resist the butter and bread! And the recommendations for wine pairing was perfect too. We choose to have only 2 glasses and the sommelier took the time to discover our taste before recommending something. Thanks a lot to the whole team for that wonderful evening!"
"After researching a few restaurants, I decided to dine at La Dame de Pic for our anniversary dinner. Honestly, it’s such a good decision!
Service was impeccable! Every single dish was amazing. When I read the menu, I wasn’t sure if I were going to like everything but oh boy, I definitely judged too quickly because I LOVE every single one of them!
Thank you for making our 2nd anniversary dinner such a wonderful experience! I’ll definitely come back! :)"
"There are high expectations for a two Michelin star restaurant - amazing ambiance, outstanding food and great service - and La Dame de Pic met all of them.

Firstly, there isn’t a “bad table” at the restaurant - they are all different but offer both privacy and great atmosphere. Staff was exceptional - friendly, knowledgable and chatty. The food was extraordinary and the wine list was surprisingly well priced.

We went for a 6 course meal and there were many highlights. We love carbs and their bread with tonka bean butter was certainly memorable. Crab dish was gorgeously succulent - the right mix of moreish and tangy. Baron bigot parcels were divine - nothing like anything we’ve tasted before. The turbot was absolutely delicious as was the venison and veal. Cheese and fig leaf dessert was the only forgettable dish while the rhubarb and millefeuille desserts were amazing.

We will definitely be back. Thank you."
"There are good and delicious reasons why they have 2 Michelin stars and certain expectations come when you go to a place with a known chef. They did not disappoint - from booking to communications before the actual visit to the dinner experience everything was made perfect by the whole team. We were greeted with a smile, escorted to our seats, taken care of during the entire dinner and even up to the last second when we left. They are the epitome of paying attention to dining customers.

I do not even have to review the food because service wise, it was absolutely five-star-experience! But let me indulge you, that corn amuse bouche - what a way to start with a bang! Bravo!!! You take a bite and feel and taste one thing and then another second it tastes different? It can happen with just one bite - a bite with multitudes of layers of flavors and textures until the after taste. Wow! That was quite extraordinary!

I also would like to highlight the heritage tomato and the ice cream that it came with! The Berlingots I do not have to explain, it is the best and it’s a signature dish for very very good reasons.

The seabass and caviar looked and tasted like a dish made out of magic! My tastebuds were clapping with joy! Thank you for that experience!

I would like to commend again the whole crew, they are all very passionate at what they do. From the stewards and the somelier, they definitely made our visit a special one. Thank you!"
"Fantastic 2 Michelin star French restaurant in the heart of London. The berlingots we're definitely the highlight of the night, and the wine pairing is definitely worth paying for. I'd suggest going for the 6 courses meal, which was enough to feel satisfied."
"Absolutely spectacular culinary journey! Anne-Sophie Pic's team were wonderful from the get go with their attention to detail as well as hospitality throughout the entire feast. All of the dishes were cooking masterpieces, however, the Berlingots, the Heirloom Mushroom and the Rhug Estate Venison dishes were our personal favourites and were out of this world. The subsequent move across to the Lounge where we were met by Kevin (plus his team from the Four Seasons) and had some amazing cocktails whilst enjoying the live band was another highlight. From the start we were welcomed in to a special evening that my other half and I will never, ever forget. Thank you all!"
"I had a great dinner experience at Madam Pic. My partner and I both took the tasting menu, in addition we received 3 additional small dishes from the kitchen, this was a lovely surprise. I further had a lovely gin cocktail followed by wine. Since I am not big on wine I found the recommendation of the house helpful and skilled.

The food was outstanding and I was amazed by the fine flowery notes that were hidden throughout the dishes. All dishes were very light and masterful executed. My personal favorite was the smoked beetroot, this was a new taste for me.

The atmosphere was the one of a fine dining restaurant. Nevertheless I did feel relaxed and not unnecessarily stiff or out of place.

The only thing I was not happy about this evening was at the end of the menu my Cappuccino. What I am looking for in a good cappuccino is a great crema that can mixed with smooth milk foam creating many tones of brown on top. Unfortunately, the milk foam was literally a foam and did not meet the standards of the previous foods and drinks. I hope they can improve in this regard.

In summary I had a lovely evening with great food and drinks. The prices are elevated, but for the price you buy yourself an experience, new ways food can taste and can be prepared. I completely recommend it and would be happy to dine there again."
"Overall the experience was good and the place amazing.Staff was very good,polite and attentive but unfortunately we faced some issues.We informed the staff twice for our taste preferences, I received a dish with goat cheese which I couldnt consume at all but they manage to change after I mentioned it for third time. Food stages were skipped, we had the fish course before the starter. Spent 03:00 - 3:30 hours for an 8 course menu. Sourdough with butter and cornish crab were the best."
"We are delighted at this most welcome addition to London's finest dining experiences. We found the courses sumptuous and elegant with creative refinement running throughout the meal. It is undoubtably five stars for the food which we all absolutely loved. The interior in contrast has been designed completely incorrectly. It is cold, too airy and feels a bit like sitting in a large bathroom with monotone decorations. To match the exquisite culinary style it needs to be more luxurious and intimate. Overall a beautiful meal and we look forward to our next visit."
"Went with my wife for our anniversary dinner. We had the most perfect evening. The food, service, atmosphere, decoration, location - perfect. We had the tasting menu which was £95 per person and comprised of 6 dishes. The chef also served complimentary starters. Every dish that was served was outstanding, attention to detail, taste, smell, presentation, was perfect. They also made for us a special “Happy Anniversary” cake. I highly recommend this for a special night out. Although they have one Michelin Star I wouldn’t surprise me if they got two or more. Can’t wait to try the other La Dame in France"
"First of all I have to say a big thank you to Alex, Leon and Stephanie who made our evening memorable. The service was fantastic and very attentive.

The food was absolutely delicious. Flavours galore with each dish including the butter.

We enjoyed the Crab, Berlingot, Scallops, Monkfish and ended our meal with the superb desserts the Chamomille and the world famous Millefeuille.

Great evening and we will return."
"An absolutely remarkable place to enjoy a true dining experience. The menu is particularly well designed on the drinking side which is often left to be ""wine only"". We went for a 6 course meal as a couple and were stunned by the journey. The service was also 5 stars!"
"For all the right reasons, this was one of the most memorable meals I’ve enjoyed in a while. This is intelligent food, thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was friendly and inviting, and the staff were warm and convivial. Whilst there was some confusion over our drinks orders and two errors were made, this did not detract from our experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal; some surprising combinations were expertly handled. There is nothing ordinary about the menu. I cannot wait to return. A particular highlight was the Rum Baba - a confection so light it almost needed pegging to the plate to avoid it floating off into the ether. The cuttlefish was frighteningly fresh and delicious, and the textures of cauliflower which accompanied the brill were a touch of genius. Each dish was sauced expertly and with every course I got slightly bitter that a spoonful or so left in the jug wasn’t fully dispensed by the waiter - I could have troughed the lot. This is all about fresh, innovative and supremely tasty food, and an exceptional venue."
"Booked this place as it was fairly near the accommodation that we booked. We had lunch, 3 courses and every dish was excellent, nothing to fault at all. It's simple on point food, nothing molecular (phew!), and even the amuse bouche were great. Service was friendly, in fact better than I had expected. It was definitely one of the better meals I've had over other Michelin dinings. Will definitely return!"
"Exquisite. Anne-Sophie Pic adds such floral lightness to each of her dishes. Nothing becomes too heavy, or overpowering (although parts of the mackerel and the rump were too salty), and the flavours were all married well. Portion sizes were not large however.

Service is excellent. Attentive, hospitable, graceful. Ambience is also very elegant - everything is rather low-key except for the centrepiece chandelier with spades as a play on words of Pic."
"Went there twice however the second visit was rather disappointing.

First visit: Every dishes were great and the pigeon was my favourite. Service was really good too and there was not so much guests at that time maybe because it was newly opened.

Second visit:
The tasting menu for my second visit was not very appealing compared to the first. The scallop was the best while I just forgot the rest of the menu before looking at my photos. The signature Mille-Fueille has always been delicious! Staff were very nice and gave us a private dining room without an extra charge, however the service was extremely slow this time and we have waited for more than 20 minutes in average between the courses.

I will still give it another chance as I think it’s a worthwhile dining experience!"
"The food here was excellent and beautifully presented as it should be, even for a set lunch menu. The wagyu tartare was a little lost as having a cold sorbet on top killed any flavour you could get from the meat. Whilst I wasn't convinced by the mille feuille, it was definitely a dessert that stood out above the  pear alternative (and though delightful, not worth the full £19 price tag!) What lost them my rating was the fact at lunch when people are usually on schedules, it took asking three times before we got our order taken. Not because they were rushing to do something else, but because ""a manager"" has to take it. Service standard overkill, it irritates people more to ask three times than to get someone who can't explain the menu fully (which we didn't need), common sense issue really. We also saw someone's desserts sitting on the side deflating for at least eight minutes before being served, and the gap between our main and dessert was also extensive despite saying we didn't need a gap. I'd still recommend this place, ignore the ""service"" though the staff were pleasant enough, the food was excellent at lunch time costs but for the type of restaurant this is, everything should be seamless."
"Beautiful, refined evening without any stuffiness. Tasting menu (8 courses) was interesting, though the pacing was a little slow. Wine/beverage pairing was excellent and unusual. Special thanks to Art and Alessio who took great care of us."
"Michelin-starred La Dame de Pic London is the first UK restaurant from acclaimed French chef Anne-Sophie Pic. My overall experience was unfortunately disappointing. Service was disjointed; amuse bouche was served without explanation. We had to call the waiter to explain the items to us. Water finished more than once and no one asked if we needed another bottle. We had to ask for it. We ordered drinks and a completely forgot about it. This is not the type of service that one expects at a Mechlin starred restaurant.
The fish dish was served cold. The food was good but nothing outstanding with the exception of the dessert that was fabulous."
"Dined here with my son while on business trip back in January 2020 and the experience is priceless! Had the 8 course degustation menu. Although I spent quite a bit €€€€ for both of us but heck this is a 2 Michelin ⭐️⭐️ restaurant!
Will try the 1 Michelin ⭐️ de Pic in SG soon!"
"Food  was ok. service excellent  best dish was the steak tartar,suckling pig was under seasoned, the sweetbreads were very tasty but had some sinuet  so a bit hard to eat.bread excellent butter shaped like a flower with hint of cinnamon. Deserts were very good Overall an ok meal not wow probably will never go back it’s a shame as I expected so much more"
What a delight! 2 stars well deserved (unlike another 2 stars restaurant I went in London). Great friendly service. Really well presented dishes. Perfectly cooked with wonderful flavors. Sure it’s not cheap but based on the experience I had - worth every penny. Highly recommended.
"Reasonably a two-michelin-star restaurant. Amazing tastes, accompanied by exceptional wines. Attentive, polite and smiling staff take care of the service which is of high standards."
"Beautifully presented food with very delicate flavours. Great service and very friendly staff . Amazing value for lunch.
For a Michelin star restaurant , it would have been normal for them to present an Amuse Bouche and a wider variety of petite fours which was lacking here.
Nevertheless, it was a great experience and highly recommend it"
"Last Friday, my fiancé and I had an unforgettable dining experience at 'La Dame De Pic London' to celebrate our anniversary.

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant with its stunning décor, we were greeted with a warmth and sophistication that set the tone for the evening. It was clear from the start that we were in for a treat, and we were not disappointed.

We opted for the indulgent Menu 'Voyage' with the respective wine pairing, and every single dish was a symphony itself. The culinary prowess demonstrated in each course was simply extraordinary, leaving us with no doubt that we were in the hands of master chefs. The combinations of flavors were unexpected and thrilling, while the presentation of each plate was unmatched in creativity. The culinary journey was unparalleled, and each course was thoughtfully curated to provide a unique and delicious experience.

The ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic, with a sleek, modern design that was both stylish and comfortable without being overdone.

The service provided by the waiters was exceptional, and their professionalism and courteousness elevated our dining experience to a whole new level. We would like to particularly commend the service provided to us by Alessandro, whose unmistakable passion for the establishment left a lasting impression on us.

Overall, La Dame de Pic London was a truly outstanding dining experience that we would highly recommend to anyone seeking an unforgettable meal. The restaurant's attention to detail is amazing, from the culinary artistry to the ambiance and service, and it has truly set a new standard for fine dining. We cannot wait to return to this outstanding establishment in the future.

Does all this sound like a never-ending hymn of praise? Yes, probably.
Should this restaurant be regarded in such high esteem? Yes, without question!"
"An absolutely perfect experience. I admit I did not know of Madame Pic, I discovered her food only by watching Masterchef professionals on tv. But it was worth the visit and the experience. We ordered the discovery menu and the sommelier picked for me a glass of wine that would match the first courses (I did not want to buy the full matching wine selection, 85£ sounded a bit much). But all the courses were beautifully presented and were all a discovery. Worth a visit for special occasions!"
"The best of Christmas meal that we had so far!!!
Its our annual routine to have Christmas lunch at some top restaurants in London or somewhere special.
We had been Dinner by Heston,  Marcus at Berkeley by Marcus Wareing and Alan Ducasse at Dorchester hotel.
But La Dame de Pic by Ann Sophie  Pic is another level of food experience for us this time!
From starter to Dessert just like opening a box of gift,  layer after layer that surprise you every mouthful that you taste.
The wine match were just add on the perfection to every dish served.
You can taste every single ingredient, but with perfect balance in your taste pallet with bust of flavours and surprises.
Nothing is too powerful,  but with every flavours elegantly lay on each other even after several courses that you can still remember the flavours in your mouth....
No wonder when for Marcus and Monica from Master chef still been inspired by her.
The Christmas lunch included 6 courses,  but when you finished was perfect nothing makes you feel over fill or still hungry...
The wine selection were such compliment to every course and add on to another layer of flavour to the dish...
The whole experience plus the front house team how they look after dinners was just a complete 5 senses of wonderful experience!
Truely recommend this placenta everyone who really like their food and enjoy the whole experience rather just want to see the decoration of a restaurant than food itself."
"I only gave 3 stars as I am a bit disappointed with the dishes as to my expectations and to the price I paid. We went through the discovery tasting menu.
1) the tuna dish: very fishy tuna. Not sure what this dish is trying to express. Maybe the consistency of the colour between beetroot and tuna?
2) the turbot: a bit dry and not tender. Maybe the only surprising point is the numbness in the turbot given by the pepper?
3) service lacks some details though every one is super nice! For example, you would expect the table to be cleaned from bread crumbs in Michelin two star restaurant.

Otherwise, I liked the white Mille feuille - very innovative method. The taste is very interesting unlike the traditional hot ones.

The pigeon is tender - very nice. But overall I have seen so many beetroots in the whole journey..... the chef seems to be obsessed with this for this season. Interesting!

The starter langoustine is my favourite of the night.

Wine is perfect - they have a long list with both accessible and exotic wines.

So in summary: a discovery of pepper and beetroot

150 pound per person average.
Maybe not again In the near term."
"Classical French haute cuisine. Impeccable service, inventive dishes and pompous ambience in the best sort of way. Anne Sophie Pic is a truly brilliant chef. Her London outpost is testament to that. I’ve eaten at better places, for a fraction of the price, it must be said... but the setting, food, service definitely qualifies for five stars. Great fine dining experience."
"Overall, we really enjoyed the food, the dishes were very tasty and meticulous, but we were very disappointed with the service. first forgetting to give us a menu, then also forget the wine for the first course. for the opening, we got delicious bread but that left a lot of crumbs on the table that the staff remembered to clean them just for dessert, to sum up, excellent food but the service is not  of a Michelin restaurant (and certainly not a 2-star restaurant)"""
"Truly delight to have decided to book La Dame de Pic. We were a bit disappointed about the latest restaurants we've tried with similar category but glad we decided to try again La Dame. It really shows off and stands out from other restaurants, offering great food, interesting to try and with different preparation. They really surprised us. The service was excellent as well, they did have a little mistake with a dish but they solved it spectacularly.
A must if you are a foodie!"
"We went to La Dame de Pic for Valentine's day lunch. The restaurant is in the new Four Seasons hotel in 10 Trinity Square just opposite the Tower of London.

The set lunch consists of 3 courses with 3 choices per course.

Of the starters we tried the Farmed Egg with Wild mushroom, amaranth, ginger and geranium rosat. The other starter was the Red Mullet and Foie Gras Mosaic, set in bouillabaisse jelly. The presentation, colours and flavours made the food a delight to eat.

For the main course we had the Challans Chicken with a Turnip cooked in a salt crust , umeboshi and Tasmanian pepper

My Monkfish dish came with Pumpkin ravioli in a light saffron and lovage sauce. The intensity and flavour of the pumpkin was amazing.

For the dessert the Chocolate Mousse consisted of Valhrona “Guanaja” with pine tree buds and beeswax panna cotta. The Matcha Opera was like French Opera cake but made with layers of almond sponge cake soaked in green tea and came with a delicious Roast hazelnut ice cream.

Overall a very enjoyable addition to the City with Fine French dining with an Asian twist."
"What a perfect meal.  Each bite or plate that arrived at the table was explained with knowledge and enthusiasm.  If you can, having the wine pairing (and one of our party had the non-alcoholic option)."
"Not a review about the food but how we have been treated. We booked lunch for four people for the 23rd of December 2023 for our guests who are arriving from overseas (The booking name was under Jess, in case they start saying they never heard of my booking). We emailed and asked about the offering, and they confirmed that the lunch menu is around £100 per person and, at the same time, confirmed our booking. A few weeks later, we got an email saying that the menu is now a Christmas menu and is £360 per person; furthermore, it asked us to pay the full price, which was over £1k, to secure a booking. We queried this, and they said Sorry, but we have changed our offering. It was not a great experience at all, especially for a Michelin-star restaurant. I am also surprised how your menu price can go from £100 to £360."
"Absolutely stunning! food melts in your mouth,you’d think the portions are tiny but you’d be so full after sampling all the courses. The only problem was the spacing, seating wasn’t the least bit private and I could literally hear the conversation at the next table."
"Luxurious lunching at La Dame de Pic
London has no shortage of excellent restaurants and the city hosts some fine examples of gastronomy taken to the next level. La Dame de Pic at the opulent Four Seasons hotel at Ten Trinity square is a venue set to impress the most discerning of diners. Anne-Sophie Pic is one of the World’s most decorated female Michelin star chefs and this truly beautiful restaurant is befitting of her culinary excellence.

Upon arrival at the Four Seasons hotel, we were instantly impressed by the tasteful grandiosity of the building. Deep carpets felt pleasing under foot and the tall walls featured an artistically crafted fresco set into the plaster. We passed garlands of fresh flowers to enter the central bar, featuring a grand piano at the middle of its lavish rounded room. This building was formerly the Port of London Authority headquarters and retains much of its original décor. La Dame de Pic features high ceilings and columns set with bevelled mirrors, bathing the restaurant with natural light. Guests are given plenty of space and seated on rich leather furniture. We got a glimpse of the intimate private room, which reflects the charm of the building and can accommodate 14 guests for a truly special dining experience. The venue is impressive without being stuffy and the warm, attentive staff are very relaxed and welcoming.

Anne-Sophie Pic has a reputation for producing exceptional dishes and we couldn’t wait to sample her creations. The restaurant features several menu options, ranging from a set lunch menu starting at a very reasonable £32 for two Michelin Starred courses, to an indulgent six course tasting menu, for those wanting a truly heavenly experience. We picked a four-course lunch option which featured a tour de force of cooking. The fresh cheese gnocchi paired with a velvety-smooth pepper emulsion and wild mushrooms was an amazing opener. The foie gras terrine was the richest we’ve tasted, melting on the palette with a pineapple and cardamom chutney. A Scottish scallop with smoked beetroot and grapefruit was cooked to other-worldly standards, converting a former beetroot avoider to rave about this course. A duck breast smoked with vanilla was the most perfectly cooked example we’ve tasted, with the fat beautifully rendered and the meat pleasingly pink and juicy. A delicate fillet of Cornish Brill was perfectly complimented by roasted cauliflower and a smooth coriander beurre blanc. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of the Chestnut Baba dessert, you simply must taste it for yourself.

La Dame de Pic is a luxurious restaurant we’d wholeheartedly recommend to our clients. This is a must for impressive lunches, elite corporate dining and private events where only the best will do."
"The food was exceptional - the “most classic French classics” were presented with a twist. Think of the foie gras terrine, usually paired with port jelly, being served with the most aromatic pineapple chutney, with a smooth and glossy texture. Everything was really good and innovative from start to finish - food, service, wine list, amuse bouche... the only miss was probably a (very small) biscuit among the petit fours, but who cares!"
"Had a lot of food allergies so can’t have the tasting menu, just ordered wagyu main and mille fluille for dessert, too filling. They did serve you some small “welcoming treats”, which is nothing special. I came here alone for no special occasion, just want to taste the food and it’s convenient to reach here. Have to say wagyu was too greasy, when I had even fatter kobe wagyu in Japan it was not so greasy that I couldn’t finish, I know the chef already did her best, the companion veg was refreshing but the amount was too little so couldn’t match the beef.
The dessert was made of “special yogurt cream” but I still find it too greasy. I am not an extremely picky person, but maybe that night I just chose wrong dish. Hopefully there will be special occasion that someone ask me to come here again to have a different experience.
The service was good, avoided all my allergies. I heard that the table next to me highly praised the wine and bread, they ordered a lot recurrently. Unfortunately I don’t drink alcohol, so can’t enjoy the speciality here."
"Outstanding restaurant - food was inventive and succulent, with lots of small surprises/amuse bouches along the journey.

The staff was exceptional (best I’ve seen in any restaurant, including 3* and 2* Michelin) - kind, polite and passionate. We never had to open a door or push our chair, someone would do it for us..!

Place / atmosphere were very pleasant too - beautifully appointed yet not pretentious. We felt at ease. Highly recommended"
"Le Voyage menu (longest tasting) was amazing and would highly recommend to anyone looking for interesting flavours and exceptional plated food, personally didn’t enjoy the pasta course with St Jude cheese sauce filling though…"
"We had the pleasure of trying the Voyage tasting menu with the Emotion pairing for a birthday celebration, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The dishes were all beautifully presented and tasted even better than they looked. Our favorites included the berlingots, lobster over embers, and the white millefeuille.

We also had the opportunity to visit the kitchen during our meal, and it was amazing to see the chefs at work. The kitchen is impeccably clean and organized, and the chefs are clearly all very passionate about their work."
"A delightful experience — the menu seems to reflect Chef Pic’s personality perfectly. Everything was so elegant and beautifully executed with a touch of generosity.
Special mention to Faustine and her manager for the outstanding service. It was everything we could expect: very professional, human and eager to share their passion for food. We had a memorable time and look forward to be back soon!"
"Two Michelin star restaurant for a reason. Great food, great drinks. Brilliant service! I'd definitely recommend."
"Very well presented restaurant. The staff are attentive and very friendly. The taster menu was a great choice, although some mixtures were not to my taste it was still interesting to try each course."
Really enjoyed having dinner there. The place is chique and the staff is very attentive. We also got lucky as Anne Sophie Pic was in the kitchens and came out to say hi and ask how the whole meal was going. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good Michelin experience.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder... or in this case the mouth. I don't want so spoil the experience for anybody but there comes a point where you don't want to eat the food... you want to be the food. I mean the sea bass almost gave me an existential crisis. And the hospitality! And the interior! Expensive? Yes! Worth every penny? Absolutely.
Delicious food and excellent service. The lunch menu is very affordable for this quality and you won't be hungry after it. Beautiful place all together. Strongly recommend for an occasion :) Good vegetarian options.
"Magnificent dining experience.
We have felicitated the chef, the team, especially Foustine that have made our night memorable."
Simply sublime. Taste combinations and sensations like you've never tasted. Service so exceptional the staff seem like old friends. This was heaven pure and simple.
Amazing experience. Spectacular food and friendly and attentive staff. Great wine pairing

Excellent lunch. Great presentation and service. Sommelier gave us some unusual yet complementary wines.
We had the tasting menu and it was divine! Outstanding food and service!
"We came for a casual lunch, the service and atmosphere are standard for a fine dinning restaurant. Very disappointed with the food experience though, some dishes were overcooked and too heavy on cheese /cream in general."
"Had the three course lunch menu here - i thought the food was incredibly flavourful and well-balanced. From the starter to the main to the dessert, everything was perfect. Thank you!"
"The exquisite flavours achieved here have to be the absolute zenith of the chefs craft. I have eaten in other similar quality restaurants, but nowhere has ever matched what was achieved in the sheer excellence of taste achieved and presentation. Nothing was too much trouble, allergies not just managed but the substitutions were fully in line and in every way comparable with the preferred dishes. As a final touch the policy of allowing one's own wine without corkage, was a mark of class and generosity, thank you."
I went for lunch with the family. The three course meal was £42 but worth it. Very beautifully presented dishes into which a lot of thought has gone. Excellent service and ambience.
"Excellent in every single way. The menu, the surroundings, the environment, the service. Everything is simply perfect."
"Superb experience. Fine presentation of the food, very surprising flavours and texture.
Service is amazing. Staff are very attentive."
Fantastic food and brilliant services ! They are very attentive to details and the need of the customers. Definitely worth the Michelin stars.
"This is a great room to dine in. Extremely high ceilings, yet still an intimate setting. The service was excellent - friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The food was superb. The 'not too expensive' wine we choose was first rate. What's not love about this place."
"Amazing dining experiences! The service staff are really professional and attentive.
I tried the 6-courses menu which very refreshing and flowery😃 …"
"Towards the top end of the 2 Star Michelin world this is a sublime experience in every way. The service is impeccable, the Four Seasons Hotel housing it is classy and atmosphere is genteel.
On the food side the many fish dishes stand out as some of the best we've ever had. This isn't just standard 2 star fare playing it safe either, some risks are taken and that edgy touch makes it all the more interesting.
Try it and enjoy it is our advice."
"What an amazing restaurant!
Service , food , chef … what an incredible experience!
Thank you and we will definitely be back !!! ❤️"
"Absolutely beautiful meal, wonderful wine and service. The only negative thing was the cheese pebbles, white chocolate and stilton is too challenging for me!"
"We arrived on time for our lunchtime booking and we both chose from the set menu. The food and wine were to the familiar high standard that the restaurant is known for. The level of service was, quite frankly, atrocious.

The restaurant certainly didn’t seem short of staff, however: we waited 25 minutes from arrival to be brought the food menus despite already having our drinks and having asked twice for the menus. There was confusion amongst the staff as to who was serving us and what had and hadn’t been provided. 45 minutes from arrival until the starters arrived. Too long a wait between each course. We finished our wine such was the wait between courses, and no one came to ask if we wanted more - the main course had gone cold by the time we got another glass. Empty water glasses not refilled. More waiting. Plates and glasses left lying around on our and other tables (see picture) once we’d finished for almost 10 minutes.

Eventually the staff seemed to notice that something wasn’t quite right and offered us a complimentary glass of dessert wine as an apology for the wait at the start with the menus - why couldn’t they have said anything at the time? The staff has shown a complete lack of awareness of the issues throughout the meal, not just at the start, and the same level of service continued after the complimentary wine was served.

There seemed to be a lot of staff rushing around not actually doing much, impossible to get their attention. We shared the feedback with the maître d', who did apologise for the lack of service but blamed it on booking congestion, which didn’t make sense especially given the number of staff and control over the booking process.

Having been to La Dame De Pic on a number of occasions, it was an uncommon experience. One that was more reminiscent of a pub than a 2 star Michelin restaurant. Enough to say that the lunch, which I expected to run for just over an hour, took over 2 hours and left us really disappointed."
"Underwhelmed I think sums up my experience on a recent visit for dinner. Great surroundings and attentive and friendly staff are I hope a given at such an establishment but the food was not as notable as I had hoped. I am not a foodie but I felt the selection provided (in the club menu option) did not have the wow factor one hopes for. I also find it a bit irritating when the waiter, usually often with a strong foreign accent, announces all the ingredients of the current dish, leaving me little the wiser. I would prefer to retain the menu so I can review what I am eating as I eat it. Surely an important reason for going to an expensive restaurant is the food and understanding the tastes being offered. I have no major criticism of the restaurant (apart from being rather hidden away) but I would not recommend it even for special occasions such as ours."
"Honestly our experience was a “sans fautes”. The Voyage (8 dishes) brought very different tastes and everytime executed perfectly. The service was on par with expectations (very attentive, friendly and open to discussion but not too intrusive). The pairing is really special as not wine exclusive and adapted to our desserts for example. We will definitely come back."
"I visited La Dame de Pic with a group of friends for a long lunch.

The restaurant is the brainchild of acclaimed French chef Anne-Sophie Pic, who holds a hatful of Michelin stars for her family of restaurants in France and Switzerland. The Trinity Square location is her first foray in the UK, and it's certainly a memorable one.

The restaurant is in the Four Seasons Hotel, which has been carved from an historic building. So you might expect La Dame de Pic to pick up on the building's classical notes in its decor. It doesn't. The decor is modern and bright. Cherry coloured woods and notes of yellow stand out. There are sharp angles and well defined spaces. But it still manages to be comfortable, with chairs that are easy to spend an afternoon in.

The food delivers on the chef's reputation.

We all went for the tasting menu and wine matches. It was punctuated with interesting jellies and the occasional foam, but the techniques never got in the way of the flavour. The opening course of Cornish Crab was delicious and perfectly prepared. The surprise was in the blackcurrant jelly, and how well it paired with the crab. The second course, 'Berlingots,' was one of the most notable of the day. Small pasta parcels containing an explosion of cheesy goodness. They were a delight. Salmon was pleasant and well prepared. And the 'Challans Chicken' was excellent as well.

Dessert was a real highlight. 'Brie de Meaux' managed to combine a cheese course and a dessert by bringing together the strong flavour of Brie and Tahitian vanilla. It was like nothing I had tasted before, and generated mixed reactions around our table. I loved it, and thought it really worked. Others were less sure. But there's nothing like an innovation to get opinions flying, and there was no denying its technical perfection. The final dessert was White Millefeuille. Again, it was a revelation. Something rooted in a classic, but evolved and improved to please and inspire. The wine matches were generally excellent and well paired.

All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at La Dame de Pic, and I'm happy to recommend it. But...

Le Dame de Pic currently holds one Michelin star, and is clearly chasing a second. It is certainly charging two star prices. But for my money, it hasn't quite reached the two star level. The menu was delightful, but the ingredients were pretty conventional and uninspired. To be really reductive, the savouries were basically crab, cheese pasta, salmon and chicken. There was nothing challenging. Nothing that begged us to push our culinary comfort zone. The brie / vanilla course was the only real exception.

And while service was attentive and excellent, it didn't manage to get to the next level, taking the measure of our group and adapting the approach to make the most of our experience. For example, our group loves wine. At past lunches, we have attracted more than our share of time from the sommelier discussing the wines, their origin, and the reason they were chosen. Our sommelier at La Dame de Pic was lovely, friendly and kind, but never managed to get past a read of the label and a quick description of the wine, and all usually too hard to hear.

I hasten to add that these are nitpicks.

The food was excellent, and the service was great. You should go and eat at La Dame de Pic. But taking the price and aspiration into account, La Dame de Pic doesn't quite reach the heights that it's pursuing."
A stunning Kagoshima wagyu beef in this tasting menu. It was a wonderful dining experience in this restaurant.
"We visited the restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and we could not have picked a better place. The food is exquisite, every dish tastes better than the other. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful, nothing is too much for them. A truly memorable dinner and evening and we cannot wait or return."
Divine experience. Inventive dishes and great for special occasions. Service was impeccable.
"I brought my dad here for lunch and we had the 6-course menu. Although the staff were welcoming and attentive, the food was underwhelming. Nothing was memorable, lamb was under seasoned, certain dishes were overpowering and overall rather unpleasant. I requested a sweet cocktail but the recommendations were sharp and sour. Disappointing as this was a return visit to La Dame de Pic having visited in December 2021 and had a wonderful meal. They were kind enough to offer a complementary dessert as I think they could tell we had not enjoyed the meal. However at their price point, I expect a higher standard of cookery. After this recent experience, regrettably I would not recommend this restaurant to friends as it was style over substance."
"Wow. Just wow. Me and my partner booked for our anniversary, and we had the best dinner ever. The attention to the detail is exceptional. We went for the 7 courses menu, and every single course was just incredible. The layers of flavour, the structure of the menu and the extraordinary touches of finesse were a jubilee for the palate. Just a little heads up: a few amuse bouche are served before the actual tasting begins, therefore if you are not a big eater I would recommend to go for the 5 courses instead. Everyone works in unison, like a well oiled machine, furthermore the staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and they go above and beyond to make the whole experience unique. Bravo! Merci pour cette expérience, à bientôt sans doute !"
"I had high expectations for this restaurant. In some ways those expectations were met: the furniture is custom, the steak knife states “Pic” on it, cutlery was changed with each course and water and drinks were refilled. However there were some misses: the food is more art than food. I thought taste was secondary which was unfortunate. The main dishes berlingot and mille feuille were forgettable. I also had the impression that staff were trained like army cadets to memorize aspects of each course since it is a set menu and to push certain wines. However, if you asked an off question they didn’t know how to answer it. I probably should not have ordered martinis but I thought a true Michelin restaurant should be able to accommodate all requests. However the waiter seemed confused by our request to have a martini not wine and it took 4 cocktails before the waiter asked if we wanted a certain type of gin.

Overall I am glad I came but I would not run back at £150 per person."
"Dame De Pic is a two Michelin starred French restaurant situated by Tower Bridge tube station in central London. The restaurant is situated within a top hotel and specialises in Southern/South East French cuisine. Which is understandable as Chef Pic is from that heritage. My wife and I visited in July 2021 for our wedding anniversary.

Pros:
The food is stupendous. Tasty. Creative. And a sight and wonder to behold. For the taste buds, the eyes, and for all the senses indeed. Furthermore, service is impeccable. The staff are friendly, professional, courteous yet impeccably trained and oh so knowledgeable on the restaurant's various dishes. Most impressive. I was most impressed by Stephanie, Art and Walter especially. Job well done! I especially liked the attention to detail by the team. Stephanie's team noticed I was on my wedding anniversary meal and took appropriate action. Most impressive! I have decided I will spend my anniversaries here every year from henceforth! Imagine if you came here to propose marriage to your loved one!

Cons: None really. Prices are fair in view of the quality of the food and establishment. Lovely high ceilings. Staff did not rush me at all. The soap dispenser on the left hand side ran out of soap in the men's toilet, but really, I can't find any flaw or fault in the restaurant. Well done!

In short, Dame De Pic is the London outpost of Chef Pic's international Michelin starred gastronomic empire and serves superb French food. I had a great time there, would recommend it unreservedly and look forward to visiting them again soon for great tasting French food. Well done guys!"
A fantastic tasting menu and real attention shown to the drink pairings. The descriptions were sometimes difficult to understand due to the staff speaking very quickly but that's my only gripe. The service was flawless and it was a truly magical evening for both of us.
"Excellent and very floral cuisine.
Unfortunately the coffee was quite poor, especially for a restaurant with such standards.
Knowing this, you can choose from a sublime tea selection though."
I enjoyed the set lunch menu with the wine paring. It was lovely.
"A very interesting meal with tasty food! Unusual flavour combinations and definitely one for a special occasion. One course was cold and had to be sent back without anything being removed from the bill - which was a bit surprising. We were also given a wrong dessert but they’d provided an extra one as an apology for cold food (although they did this to all tables) and so it wasn’t an issue. But just a few problems that you wouldn’t expect from a 2* restaurant. We’d go back though, hopefully it was just a one off bad day."
"Wow, maybe the best 1 michelin star restaurant in London!"
"An incredibly delicious experience with fantastic service and a classy decor.
The only 2 things I would say are holding this place back from perfection was the coffee and the music.
I chose a single Geisha which, at £14 a shot, I was expecting bigger things from.
The playlist was a slightly out of place for an establishment where so much thought has gone into the details."
Very nice food and atmosphere. French with a hint of Japanese totally deserve a Michelin star❤️💗 …
Every single dish we tried was excellent here. Hop to return soon.
"amazing experience.  my first time in a 2 Michelin star restaurant and all my expectations were met. impeccable service, knowledgeable staff and delicious food. one extra mark to our sommelier Alessio, he walked us through a full journey with his extensive knowledge of wines. Thanks all"
"Absolutely fantastic food, very good staff, better than most 3 Michelin restaurants in London."
"We did the extended tasting menu over the weekend. Everything from the food, the wine pairings to the atmosphere, staff and decor was absolutely fantastic. The sommelier was incredibly knowledgeable and the pairings worked brilliantly. The GM, Stephanie, was especially welcoming and very friendly. All in all and absolutely amazing experience. Thank you!"
"Firstly,  the service was brilliant! Professional,  friendly staff.  However, apart from the steak tartare, the food was confusing on the palette and unbalanced.  Very strange for a 2 Michelin star restaurant.  There is a fine line between experimenting and good flavour combinations which was comprised on this occasion. All of us around the table agreed that the beautiful looking plates,  with clearly good cooking techniques just tasted strange verging on unpleasant. Thank you to the staff though for making the overall experience positively memorable. Watch out,  I might steal your team for my next venture! 😀"
"The most amazing and innovative food I have ever eaten.  Great attention to detail led to superb presentation and flavours.

The sommellier that matched the wines to our courses was astounding. Knowledgeable and thoughtful in his choices.

Being coeliac makes dining out problematic but I knew with absolute confidence I would not need to worry. The friend we dined with has an intolerance to garlic and her needs were met in the same attentive way.

Dishes were adapted to suit my need but with no compromise on taste or presentation."
"Just wonderful. Food is an utter delight, full of surprises. The room ( and hotel)  is just beautiful, and the staff are so professional, but fun.  The moment you leave your dining chair masks must be on, if you forget, you will be reminded instantly and offered a disposable one if necessary - politely but firmly, you feel safe. They had only been open two days when we went, but the entire staff are engaging and warm. We were admiring the stunning photo series of Karl Lagerfeld and immediately offered a tour telling us about each one. They are part of a very exciting Afternoon Themed Tea which will be really fun. It was expensive, but good value,  a really fabulous afternoon."
"Returning to la Dame de Pic was sort of a disappointing visit. The disces were either too salty (the Dover sole and others) or uninteresting (like the John Dory). There was a taste, a smooky salty taste, on the amuse bouches that was then repeted on another dish, like if they had run off options. The berlingots and the desserts are still delicious as they were in the past. As the pros.. Art the assistant manager was attentive and pleasant elevating the overall experience."
"My wife and I had the most wonderful and memorable meal here last night. We really couldn't fault anything- service, attention to detail , and most importantly the food!. Highest compliments to the chef and the team here who treated us superbly. They deserve more than a Michelin star for what they have set out and created here. We had some dietary requirements which was accommodated so so well. Very impressed and for sure our new favourite restaurant in London. Cannot wait to come back. 🤗🥇"
"Perfect cooking, flavour and service. Super friendly team, value is off the charts. You could quite easily spend the same on lunch at a run of the mill casual dining chain.

Special mention for the bread. The bread is so good, if they let me, I would visit just for bread and a whisky!

Merci,

Allez les Bleus!"
Great service and good food. We opted for a 5 course taster menu which I would recommend. It's good value at £45 per person plus service.
"Excellent dining experience...…..
The atmosphere is a bit more relaxed than other 2* Michelin restaurants and have to say, the quality of the food is up there with 3* restaurants such as Alain Ducasse and Gordon Ramsay.
Tasting menu (5) courses was fantastic and was a real treat.
Definitely dining there again."
Fantastic. Everything was above expectation except for some loud Americans who spoilt the atmosphere for us.
Amazing! Lunch menu is superb for the price. Wine brilliant. What an experience! Try it!
"Artistic and delicious dishes, served by friendly and knowledgeable staff."
"Fantastic lunch. Had a gift voucher and treated impeccably. Chose the two wine pairing to go with the starter and main. Choosing the middle extra dish is well worth it, as is the signature millefeuille. Atmosphere very good and service excellent!"
"Amazing!!!!! Best desertwine I ever had. The food was great, but the wine was amazing! 5 stars!"
"Awesome, awesome and awesome! We had their lunch set menu, everything was very tasty, balanced and delicate. The Berlingots was one of the best things I've tasted in my life. We are definitely going back to have the full tasting menu.
Last but not least the staff was very accommodating, knowledgeable and they made me an awesome bday cake."
"Absolutely amazing food. Dishes, I've never experienced before. Had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Not blown away with their choice of Red, but, the rest was amazing. Service was superb and such a friendly staff. The somilalor was so informative. Would 100% return and recommend."
Well worth it's 2 stars. Sublime dining and amazing service
"Had an incredible time for my Birthday meal at La Dame de Pic London the food was flawless as was the service, everything about this restaurant was fantastic. The restaurant itself is relaxed and comfortable with a grand fill to it, i cant recommend this restaurant enough. P.S the sweet breads were incredible."
"A lovely restaurant in a beautiful hotel setting.  Staff escorted me from Reception to the restaurant bar for me to wait for my guest. Later they escorted her to meet me - excellent service.

Had the tasting menu with the wine flights.  All excellent and courteously served. Five stars because I couldn’t fault the food, wine or service. It was a Monday evening - and in a hotel restaurant - so the ambiance was lacking. I’m sure, on a busier night, this would make a very romantic venue."
"We attended for lunch at La Dame De Pic London. The pricing was reasonable and it was nice to have an option to have an extra dessert, main, or starter, and the decor and hotel were very nice.

Whilst the food was generally good, I chewed down on a hard bone in my shredded lamb (certainly not supposed to be there!). When this was pointed out to a member of staff after the meal, they were at first apologetic but said ‘these things do happen, I once had someone find a bullet in their duck’ and joked ‘oh I hope there are no bones in the dessert, no bones are there?’ after clearing desserts and laughing with another waiter, which was perceived to be quite mocking.

The waiting staff did bring over a further bottle of water between our starter and main and started pouring it, which we didn’t ask for. They did repeatedly try quite hard to sell the wine and non-alcoholic cocktails and staff were significantly more attentive to tables that were having wine.

The portion sizes were smaller than at comparable Michelin starred restaurants and there were no pre-desserts or petit fours. It took quite some time for plates to be cleared, despite significant numbers of waiting staff.

At first, the service was pleasant, but it slipped between the main and dessert, as we waited around an hour between our main and dessert. We prompted a waiter mid-way during the wait who said he would find out what was happening and was rather unapologetic, but didn’t return. We made eye contact with and tried to call over several members of staff who would look directly at us then look away, as if not wanting to (or being instructed not to) manage the situation, which was really odd. When we ordered a small pot of tea, this again took around 20 minutes to arrive.

Whilst the waiting staff said these waits ‘were because of an issue with the desserts in the kitchen’ more generally, some other tables were being served their desserts as normal.

The restaurant did take off the small pot of tea and a supplement charge from the bill, but this didn’t make up the full cost of service (and the water we didn’t ask for) and a 15% service charge was added to the bill, which I thought was a little insulting, given our experience. We asked them to remove the service charge to account for the significant wait and service-related issues and they obliged.

Our overall experience was certainly not in keeping with a restaurant holding two Michelin stars."
Absolutely incredible experience as the food was amazing.  The service was impeccable and we felt really warmly welcome.  Our lunch was perfection personified and we very much appreciate all the effortless looking hard work that goes into making this wonderful place a worthy Michelin Star restaurant.
"All staff made sure I had a fantastic experience, they were not merely very good in their job, they were also genuinely interested in connecting with guests and had engaging personalities that made you feel like they really appreciate you. The Journey menu was a collection of art piece, each unique and with incredibly well balanced flavors and textures. I could not have had a better experience."
"Absolutely stunning food, brilliant atmosphere and truly high standard cuisine. One of my favourite meals to date"
"I found it odd how easy it was to get a booking here. In fact on the Friday night we visited, they were perhaps only half occupied. Anne Sophie Pic is a 3 starred chef (albeit this location has just 1 star), plus she was formerly voted best female chef in the world. On paper, she sounds like a direct competitor to Clare Smyth. But good luck getting a booking at the latter! The restaurant is housed within a Four Seasons hotel. The décor was fine, without being particularly memorable. The menu we were presented with had more options versus the website version. We were able to choose between 4, 6 or 8 course tasting menus. The 8 course menu felt a bit steep at £160, so we went for the 6 course option (£120), plus the accompanying wine pairing (£95). We enjoyed the food. Beautifully presented plates which were not short on flavour, although some courses were more enjoyable than others."
"Amazing
We are French and we want eating Like in France !
We love thé provence because we sent there for the holidays
And in France we love eating and cooking si we decided to eat Like in France but in London!
I love what we eat here a wonderful journey with Anna Sophie pic
Thank you a lot Anne Sophie for your professionnalisme of preparing all the dishes
Congratulations
Mr and Mrs Bouffeteau"
Quite outstanding in almost every way. Wonderful food really beautifully presented. Sometimes I felt it was almost a shame to eat what was on my plate but when I did it was even more of a superb experience. The roast quail was excellent. Small well chosen menu. Very good service. Not cheap but you won't forget the meal or the experience.
"Hits all the marks. It is a classy affair, as you'd expect in the four seasons, but doesn't feel overly ceremonial.

The dishes are eye catching and full of flavour with a distinctly feminine flair, while the sommelier provides a great pairing with a few nice surprises along the way."
"This was a very nice restaurant with excellent food and service. We had the Voyage menu with a pairing wine. I have to say Batiste the sommelier was brilliant and 7 out of the 8 wines were really excellent or interesting. Excellent pairing. We also loved the infusion of martini, gin and herbs and elder flower liqueur, superb. The cocktail Americano great, the one with rose, forgotten its name was a bit insipid. Batiste had superb knowledge. Walter, our main waiter was also attentive and great knowledge.
The food was yummy, it deserves its one Michelin, we usually dine at 3 Michelin star restaurants and it compared reasonably well. The meats were cooked to perfection, loved all the leaves and flowers. the baby tomatoes had excellent flavour. the Welsh lamb was definitely one of my favorites, together with the white chocolate Stilton stones, what a revelation. Of course the signature white chocolate mille feuille was innovative, but the strawberry baba was also a great delight. All in all fabulous evening and your staff were a credit to you."
"Great food and friendly staff, really great atmosphere and not pretentious."
"Great food experience and extremely friendly staffs. But compared to the experience at Michelin 3 star restaurants, foods were relatively boring and all foods were similar. So it might need more imaginations."
Just been here for a Birthday lunch. Staff were fantastic and very attentive. The food tastes amazing right from the first course through to dessert. At the end of the meal they presented me with a cake on a plate with happy birthday written on it. What a lovely surprise especially as its our last day in London
"We arrived 9pm sharp which was our reservation time. Straight away we were told our table wasn't ready yet so we were placed at the bar. Nothing complimentary was offered for the wait, no one checked up on us the entire time (even though there was another French couple that arrived after us and someone that looked like the manager checked up on them), no one told us how much longer it will take until our table is ready.

After 30 mins wait at 9.30pm, I queried finally how much longer our table will take, we were seated at 9.45. We sat there for a while until menus were presented by the bar tender that was working at the bar. Again, no one bothered asking us if we had questions. After another 15 mins, a waitress wearing orange trainers (this is a Michelin star restaurant and service staff wore orange trainers?!) took our orders. During all these waiting around both at the bar and at the table, we noticed that there were other people that arrived after us but somehow were seated, served promptly and were taken care of.

We weren’t clear who our waiter/waitress was so when we needed help, we didn’t know who to ask. It was my birthday on Saturday and my boyfriend wanted to let the staff know before dessert was ordered, however he couldn’t find anyone at all to communicate this with.

Food was good and full of flavour. However, the unprofessional service for a Michelin star restaurant took our enjoyment away for a special occasion. From what I know about Michelin star restaurants, they are rated not just for the food but for the perfect service they give too."
"Staff Friendly and attentive without being overbearing. We had the set menu at £42 a head. Wine was very overpriced. I've had better from Tescos and a bottle of water at £5 is a bit steep.
Food nice and well presented but you may be hungry quite soon afterwards.
Lovely setting and building."
Somewhat underwhelming food. Food was bland but beautifully presented. We choice the wine pairing which was a mistake as we had very odd wines served all but one of which were very sweet. Not value for money. 600 for 3 of us.
Impeccable service and just a wonderful experience. It was hard to choose as everything looked delicious but the legendary millefeuille is a must.
"Great experience, superb cuisine, elegant, feminine, French and English inspired with some asian twist, 1 michelin star after just 4 months opening, not bad at all! We had the Tasting venue with wine pairing, worth the price, the sommelier managed to get a sample of international wine that works well woth the well executed dishes. Loved the signature dish, berlingot pasta filled with cheese, very gourmand! Overall experience was brill and staff is superb."
"We have been there for the lunch time and we were really excited about it. Unfortunately the service was really poor, really low level for a place who want to reach a michelin star. No one of the Chef de Rang or Managers have got properly our order, because they mistaken all the times the dishes positions and even the mise en place was wrong for all the dishes; such a shame.
About the kitchen the dishes were really nice, well presented and rich in flavors and colors, and we really enjoyed the food, which definitely deserve a michelin star.
Unfortunately kitchen and service are working in two different levels.
Really really disappointed."
"Out of my London Michelin restaurant visits sadly this has to be my least favourite, the service was very good, the menu interesting, and the presentation very good, but there seemed to be an over reliance on using bitter flavours in ALL of the dishes, for me it did not complement the dishes! Also the cocktail menu was very short with little choice."
"It was meant to be a fabulous dinner but instead turned out to be a mediocre meal. For a 2-star Michelin restaurant, the variety served and the flavours in 8-course tasting menu were lacking big time. We were all disappointed that this was coming from the kitchen of a chef who owns 8-stars across her 5 restaurants. Except the ambience of Four Seasons hotel and a decent service, it is an forgettable dining experience."
"Sadly it was a huge disappointment. Our first waiter ( with spikey hair) had an issues with offering me gluten free items/ I am allergic to options - he made faces when I said I cannot have beetroot amuse-bouche - I cannot. After forgetting about the orders 4th times he seemed to lose his patience and basically threw my little plate on the table which I took in silently due to respect to other guests.
Our glasses were never filled up with water without asking, we were waiting 3 times for Evian more than 15 mins,  similarly with gluten free rolls. Constant mistakes - asked for salad without any dressing I received it dressed etc.   Restaurant was not busy at all and pretty empty.
Food - bread was very nice, langoustine also lovely, light and flavours go together well. John Dory overcooked terribly with not matching sauce - absolutely coffee cocoa jus doesn't go well with it. I left almost the entire dish untouched.  Food was arriving very delayed.  Thankfully then I had a bread with butter to snack on. Definitely not what I was expecting in the slightest unfortunately. No one ever was checking up on us.  Wouldn't recommend unfortunately."
"We had a great experience. Very nice and professional staff, superb food and service."
"Number one restaurant in London and no other - French or non, comes even close. You go with high expectations that are exceeded by the time you are done with the first course. Service is very very good and quiet unlike some of the more snooty places in London. Bland ambience, but for the meal alone it deserves more than five stars."
My first time at a michelin star restaurant and I'm happy!
"One thing can be said about today's extended  lunch here, not only fine dining, but also fun dining. Lovely space, with 5m tall ceilings, airy with almost casual, yet beautiful air. The welcome and the service I received from personable and affable restaurant manager Nicolas Bierry, and his  staff, including Alvin, was much appreciated. The sous chef Giacomo Tranquili made his head chef proud by getting to my table a perfectly cooked quail, which first comes out in a smoking cast iron dish, and then is beautifully served with, again, a perfectly cooked piece of foie gras. Scottish langostines were good, desserts I don't really get excited about, even here, though the tea selection was a nice touch (go with Alvin's recommendation!). Fab experience I would like to repeat before too long."
"Food was disappointing - it was either too soggy or too salty and they looked cheap. Maybe their usual menus are better (we went there for Christmas) Service was ok - you’d expect more welcoming staff from a five star hotel.

Foie gras Creme Brulee - the portion was tiny and it was VERY salty

Marinated sea bass - the sake ice cream was too bitter to eat and it doesn’t go well with the sea bass at all.

Pasta parcels - the only dish that I truly enjoyed. Juice in the parcels exploded in my mouth very nicely. Interesting dish with great balance of different tastes.

Scottish langoustine - ok

Venison and Foie gras pivithiers - it was too soggy. The foie gras was too soft and everything simply fell apart when you cut it and the two meat didn’t go well with each other. Both the sauce and the pivithiers were too salty (again)

“Mimolette” - way too salty (AGAIN)

Dessert - The London-themed dessert looked and tasted cheap."
"We came for the Lunch Set Menu today, which was absolutely amazing, the entire staff was very friendly, the wine pairing from the sommelier was extremely well matched. An overwhelmingly great experience overall !"
"Service - exceptional
Food - very good, fresh ingredients, unique flavor combinations, exceptional presentation, some dishes were too interesting for me, would highly recommend beef, lamb and Mille-feuille
Atmosphere - exceptional
Overall experience - 4.5 out of 5"
"The most beautiful, instagramable food you will find. Service also perfect. Taste and paired wines are ok. Balance of flavours often a bit off (eg too much citrus with everything for our taste, especially in winter). Decor and Muzak also not quite our taste."
"A rare combination of exceptional food and attentive, friendly service within beautiful surroundings.  The lunch set menu is a must.  I am fortunate to have been here twice and experienced truly incredible food on both occasions.  Long may this continue!"
"An amazing modern french menu, outstanding! It was a great experience, good food and good wines. The pairing was really perfect. Congrats for all people who work at La Dame de Pic."
"Absolutely loved it.
The food was unbelievably outstanding, probably the best experience of fine dining I've ever had. Service wonderful, friendly  informative but not intrusive.
Highly recommend. What a treat."
"A great front of house team and marvellous team in the Kitchen. Beautifully balanced dishes and the Risotto was superb and my wife normally bans me from eating Risotto out, as I am often disappointed. Glad I decided to risk it😊. Will return. …"
They got an amazing atmosphere. Attention to detail in customer service and beautifully crafted food is second to none. Really enjoyed the experience.
"I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. We took our Christmas dinner here and their Christmas menu was awful. My girl said that the only good thing was their bread~~Service is ok, except that the waiter admitted that he forgot the recipe. They love cheese so much that they give you bread and said in case you feel too creamy haha"
"Brilliant would be an understatement. Sheer bliss, great food, good wine list & excellent staff who explained in detail everything you were going to eat. One minor fault, lighting at table poor, aggravated by the small typeface on menu, torch from mobile phone used."
"Wonderful courses each dish was unique...surprised to hear awarded two Michelin stars recently... There were no standout dishes for me however... All cooked exceptionally well but none to rave about.

The restaurant has a more relaxed environment for three accolades. Four seasons hotel very glamorous!"
Unreal. What an experience. The food was immaculate. Constantly challenges your expectations of flavour from the appearance. The service was exceptional to boot. I could not recommended this more highly.
"Incredible ambience and interesting, beautiful food (though as a whole overly complex for me)
However 3 things really put us off 1) there was a SNAIL in the heirloom mushrooms - my partner almost cracked his tooth 2) there was a small shell in the crab 3) there was someone else's hair on my napkin
For such a restaurant, you would imagine more care would go into the details (actually these are just basics, right...)"
"One of my favorite  spots in London. Beautiful bar, amazing cocktails and tasty food."
Can food get better on each visit or is it an illusion? Very few venues retain this degree of ambience and seemingly improving menus. What a super fine place to have lunch!
"Absolutely brilliant food, superb service, great ambiance. Quite expensive but worth every penny. A memorable meal.  For us it would be special occasions only, but will certainly visit again."
Exceptional and well worth two stars. Every course of the 6 course taster was exceptional. Recommend the Cotes du Rhône “Domaine de l’Espigouette” at £49 is fantastic value.
"Such a wonderful experience, everything was perfect 👌,  cannot wait to come back again"
"La Dame De Pic London is outstanding.  Having visited the Parisian restaurant I decided to try the new London base. I was hoping it would be a different concept to Paris and it was. Outstanding food, amazing innovations and great service. Enjoy!"
Amazing food - the lamb shoulder and millefeuille were favourites in particular. Service was really attentive too. Thank you for the great celebration lunch :)
Amazing dining experience. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Service was fab too. I'd highly recommend it.
Fabulous service and good value 5-course tasting menu with most fresh and seasonal ingredients. 20 extra for wine pairing.
"Excellent evening, primo experience. Staff was top notch and the chefstmenu was a delight. If you are looking for a signature experience, this is the place."
Beautiful food. Sauces were too salty but service perfect. The original location in Valence is much better.
A must if you are in the area !!! And try the desserts...
"The dinner was an amazing tempest of colours, sensations, shapes and interactions. Hope it will get soon a Michelin star 🌟 …"
Shocked to see foie gras on the menu. Surely today this is no longer an option.
"Incredible. Next level food, the entire experience was amazing with brilliant service. Can't ask for more."
"Deserves more attention than many Michelin restos. Lunch was excellent, would warrant a visit for dinner!"
"We had such a beautiful experience with the food,  the wine, the service, the place.  Absolutely perfect."
My friends loved it. They said that the Turbot was the best that they had ever had. The lamb was perfect. Thank you.
Wonderful special food beautiful to look at an delicious to eat. Staff very professional but not stuffy.
"Very nice lunch here! Cuttlefish was excellent! Lovely servers, very professional"
Lovely. What a charming little place. Looking forward to our next trip in Jan
"Modern and tasty menu, one of the best 2 michelin stared restaurant in london."
"We had a truly wonderful evening the food was superb excellent service
I highly recommend this restaurant"
Fab food! Lunch menu was very nice. Great attentive service.
"Amazing experience, the food and service were perfect, probably one of the best place I've ever been to"
Absolutely outstanding!!!!! If you have the chance to visit be sure to go & try the tasting menu ❤
"Superlative food, attentive and friendly service for a classy yet relaxed experience. Perfect for that special occasion"
Very comfortable atmosphere over delicious food and champagne. That’s amazing.
Lovely place where I enjoyed a wonderful lunch. Special mention to the dessert which was fabulous
"Amazing food, fantastic service in a relaxed atmosphere. Loved it 🙂 …"
"Food, staff and atmosphere were all at a very high level, would defnitely recommend"
Simply put: by faaaaaaar the best dinner! Amazing! 25 stars out of 5
"Fancy place, a bit over-elaborated in terms of preparation and undersized in terms of portion. Excellent service."
Not very tastes. Good for coffee or ice cream 🍨 but not for lunch or dinner. …
Very friendly staff and great food. Very good birthday treat
"Amazing, recommend a visit.  Excellent atmosphere, food and great service."
Good food and strong wine list. Would come back for drinks.
"This place is so luxurious, and its perfdct to celebrate with family, the food and service are excellent"
Creative modern and simply very very good ... Highly recommended!
Everything and more that would expect from  Anne Sophie! Fine-dining at it's best!
"La Dame de Pic London📍10 Trinity Square, London EC3N 4AJ四季酒店算是伦敦靠近泰晤士河比较新建造的酒店之一，整体装潢奢侈大方，酒店内也有很多好吃的餐厅，这次我和@食在英国 就去拜访了米其林一星La Dame de Pic London。米其林餐厅的特色就是，如果主厨是女生，其细腻程度真的很容易看出来，之前的core也是这种风格。Anne Sophie Pic是世界上最受欢迎的米其林星级女厨之一，独特的烹饪风格给这家餐厅带来了奇妙的体验。一开场的面包，将黄油制作成雕花的模样，另外一个小点心也是做工精细的红色花朵模样，放置在白色的餐布上，用一点点黄色和绿色做点缀，格外好看，设计很细腻。Bluefin TunaBeetroot, pickled Tropea onions with hibiscusWild berries and Tasmanian pepper ice cream蓝鳍金枪鱼，甜菜根和洋葱，搭配野生莓果和塔斯马尼亚胡椒冰激淋其实鱼肉新鲜好吃就算了，他们家的酱料真的别具一格，因为酱汁和水果混合在一起的味道很新鲜，吃起来就很爽口。BerlingotsPasta parcels with Gruyère and Vacherin cheeseSeasonal wild mushrooms, woodruff, barley and roasted hazelnut consommé意大利面包裹着奶酪，搭配当季野蘑菇和大麦清汤意大利面制作的这种饺子状的食物其实还蛮有东西方融合在一起的感觉，咬开来满口奶酪的感觉，还挺有罪恶感的，野蘑菇和汤汁相当加分，能中和掉一部分的油腻感（可能爱吃奶酪的不觉得油腻），口感上也能再上一个层次，搭配的很棒。Scottish LangoustineSeared in shellfish butter with heirloom carrotsBouillon infused with pine tree buds and coffee苏格兰海螯虾，搭配贝类黄油和胡萝卜，泡在松树芽和咖啡里这道海鲜绝对加分，值得尝试，特别添加的酱汁将海鲜的风味发挥到了极致，而且虾肉鲜嫩，是真的有那种嚼劲和优秀海鲜的口感，食材的本身品质更加加分！Organic Welsh LambMarinated in melilot and Chartreuse Spring vegetables glazed with pollen butterPadrón pepper light purée有机威尔士羊肉 浸泡在蜜汁的春季蔬菜中，用花粉黄油上色，搭配帕德隆胡椒酱羊肉很大一块，当然这个主菜也可以替换成beef，羊肉没有很重的味道，酱汁将其食材本身的味道散发到了极致，边上一圈的绿色蔬菜酱汁，是比较清新的感觉，还有莴笋（大概是）搭配两朵小花作为点缀，造型上也别具一格，非常吸睛。Stilton BluePebbles, white chocolate and meadowsweet斯蒂尔顿蓝芝士，鹅卵石，白巧克力和甜菊糖喜欢吃芝士的人一定格外爱这个芝士，放在一堆鹅卵石当中，略感普通的造型，藏着美味！千层蛋糕切开来的切面非常好看，而且蛋糕整体比较紧实，所以切的时候还挺有动感的！甜品是一道由各种冰激淋混合而成的，由葡萄酒浸泡的小甜品，搭配错落有致的切片莓果和樱桃还有蔬菜，摆盘精致口感绝佳！"
"Refined dishes, perfectly paired wines, very pleasant and competent staff = everything comes together to have a perfect time"
Infinite delicacy in flavors. An excellent French restaurant with impeccable service
"Good food from start to finish
Excellent service, very welcoming and friendly staff"
Wonderful experience for our anniversary!  We loved every single dish. I ordered a pescaterian menu and my husband the normal one. I especially enjoyed how well balanced everything was and how flavourful every bite was. It's definitely worth it. We will visit again!
"We visited for my partners birthday and were treated to an impressive culinary journey over the 8 course tasting menu.

One of the desert dishes was not to my taste, and the owner made extra efforts to make up for this with an additional delightful desert of mushroom ice cream with truffles. Beautiful venue, perfect levels of service.

Worth noting that they may want to be mindful of table placement and managing glare coming through the high windows with some sort of blind or ensuring tables are placed to best avoid glare, as there were 20 minutes were I was somewhat staring into the sun and had to reorient the table (understandably only seasonal due to the low winter sun!)."
"Congratulations on the 3 Michelin star ✨⭐
We had a brilliant evening at this restaurant, Ledbury. Food was awesome and the service was dramatically friendly and of course professional... everything was much more than we expected.
We cannot wait to go back for another special experience."
We visited yesterday for my birthday and what a wonderful experience. The food was superb with some of the dishes amongst the best that I’ve tasted. The kitchen accommodated our dietary requirements and presented a lovely birthday surprise. The service was charming and attentive but unobtrusive. The atmosphere was nice and the decor is beautiful. However towards the end of the meal as people started to leave it did get very quiet with no music or background noise.
We went for lunch and everything was very well presented and delicious. There are so many other snacks which are not on the tasting menu so you are guaranteed to leave the restaurant having a food baby! The chef was serving the tables that day and gave me some truffles to try for free!!
"Having been to numerous Michelin star restaurants in London and around the world, I can confidently say that this place stands out from the rest and is my new favourite spot.

The service was exceptional - the staff were very attentive, welcoming and friendly. To my delight, I even had the opportunity to meet the chef, who personally introduced himself and was more than happy to answer any questions I had. The level of hospitality was truly outstanding.

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated to a high standard, creating a lovely ambience. From the lighting to the table decorations, even the glasses and cutlery, everything just had a unique touch of class that added to the overall experience.

The food was absolutely incredible. From the spectacular presentation and creativity to the variation of flavours and textures, every dish was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes, which were just perfect. To my surprise there were also several starters, side dishes, and bread provided as extras that I didn't expect as part of the menu.

The wine selection was exquisite, complementing the food perfectly. As we were there to celebrate our anniversary, the restaurant went above and beyond to make it a memorable experience. They added some special touches, including a beautiful dessert and even some lovely gifts for us to take away.

Overall, this dining experience exceeded my expectations in every way. It was truly the most enjoyable evening. I left feeling completely satisfied, and I can confidently say that the price was more than worth it and I would happily spend there again.

Thank you to the entire team for providing us with an amazing night to remember! If you are reading this review deciding if to go to not - do it! you won't regret it."
Amazing service and incredible tasting menu. My first time at a 3 star Michelin restaurant. Had high expectations which were met 100%
"We recently visited the Ledbury for a special event. They were super organised with congratulatory messages on cards for us.
The service was great and so was the personal attention to us. I guess that’s expected as it’s a two Michelin star restaurant. As usual good wine list and loads of wines to choose from even wines by glass. As expected it’s pricey and we know whenever we visit a top Michelin restaurant the prices in central London will be quite steep ( so be prepared for that )
We had the tasting menu which was really nice and some pictures are attached to my note. You wouldn’t expect to like everything but most of the courses very delicious.
Verdict 5/5
Budget easily £250/- per person and more depending on how / which wines you choose"
Had dinner which recommend by Dr Pat @pat.London #LP Lifestyle and found that amazing foods and services. I shall return….!!
"A restaurant at the height of its powers to delight. Incredible Food, Elegant Atmosphere and Flawless Service.
Memorable service by legend Brett Graham made this evening 💯🤩"
"👍The Best of the Best restaurant…👍 TOP RECOMMENDATION!!! Based on what you celebrate 🥳 , everything was so delicious 8 courses 🤤, well supplement of in house mushrooms and prepared with pleasure by chef Mr. Graham it self “Red-book mushrooms” if I can call them like that as I haven’t tasted anything like that before, always smart approach with highest attention to details…
Top Top Top of the best!!!!
In regards to price, well priced but worth!!!"
"Still incredible, still evolving.  Such a pleasure to return for the first time after the hiatus and to see new and familiar faces.  The menu is completely fresh new, and yet still comfortably 'Ledbury'.   Wonderful new ingredients from the restaurant's own herbs and mushrooms, to special supplies of meat and game, and little twists like lemongrass and kombucha all combine beautifully.  The wine by the glass selection was always interesting, but this time it really matched by tastes exactly.  For us, still the best restaurant in London.  Hope to return soon."
"This restaurant is amazing! The food was all great and the staff were super friendly! They even let us go down to to kitchen and meet the chefs which is not something all guests get. Overall, I had a great experience dining here."
"Our second visit to The Ledbury.  Across the board this is one of the finest dining experiences of my life.  The flavors, presentation, textures, and sizes are all perfection such that I left perfectly full but not overfed and with wonderful memories.

The staff are first class: personable, charming, witty, and with an innate knowledge of when to chat and when to leave you be.

I'll have to come back again.  It's just too good."
"What a delightful experience. We went for dinner and we really enjoyed every minute. The staff are very attentive and super welcoming and friendly. Every dish served was a pleasant experience, although I would have preferred larger portions to enjoy the taste longer 😂 The dishes are served over 3 hours. Overall we really enjoyed it for a special occasion, as the food served is quite unique to the restaurant, they are not common dishes that you can find at other restaurants. Overall, you pay for the experience (£250 pp)."
"Probably my best best Michelin experience!
Chef Tom and the team doing an incredible job!!
The service was outstanding!"
Had a wonderful dining experience at this fantastic restaurant. Brett and his team were fantastic from the moment we arrived until we left. Brett came out to car to to Thank us as we missed him when we left. That was a special touch on a great evening.
"Incredible food with an fantastic service team, everyone on the service team moved as one as the dishes and drinks are being served. Modern European cuisine with a light and zesty touch to the traditional. Worth a stop for special celebrations!"
"Interesting dishes overall and good value for money. We have had a good experience, they are very generous with food offered (extra dish of mushrooms for us, extra dessert and two extra snacks towards the end of our meal).

The ingredients’ combinations are creative. I did not expect that cucumber could go so well with meringue and lime sorbet, delicious lobster with purée and the goat milk butter with sourdough was fantastic, the list goes on I guess!

Thank you Jan and everyone that had assisted us throughout our dinner there. We will definitely be back soon, and whenever we are in London :)"
Incredible meal and outstanding service. We enjoyed every bite from beginning to end. The first several courses were delicate and had very balanced flavours and the mushroom and beef courses were superb. Thank you to all of the wonderful staff for an unforgettable evening and thank you again!
"Fabulous experience, top food and service, everything is impeccable.
Every dish has a rich taste, with perfect combination of different ingredients and flavors. Wonderful place for special occasions like birthday and anniversary."
"I managed to book and went on a Wednesday evening together with a friend . I always wanted to check this place but it used to be tremendously difficult to book. But now here we are at 8 PM and I can honestly say that we were flabbergasted by the food, the service, the ambience, the attention to details and pretty much everything. From the hors d’oeuvre to the final desserts and petit fours everything was mind blowing and pushing the boundaries in all the right ways . It would be inf as it to say which dish we liked most as they were all brilliantly executed and balanced. The wine pairing was also incredibly well judged as each change of wine enhanced perfectly the accompanying dish in a symphony of flavours harmonically spoiling our taste buds . The general manager, Jack, even gave us a little gift at the end when he understood my passion for mushrooms (they harvest them in the restaurant and I urge you to go and see them ) . Jack service was incredible, but so was the service of everyone else, the only problem being me forgetting the other staff’s names . The atmosphere was incredibly nice and relaxed, felt like we were at friends’ rather than in one of the best restaurant in the world ! I can’t wait to go back !"
"This was our first time in this beautiful restaurant.
We had their tasting menu, but decided against the wine pairing. We loved how the dishes just kept on getting better (not that the first ones were bad!) Fantastic Jersey beef perfectly cooked. The service was also fantastic. Looking forward to go back soon."
I have been to many fine dining restaurants in London including some really famous ones. The Ledbury is definitely on the top of my list. The environment was beautiful. Service was friendly. The food was amazing. Initially booked for a date but got bailed on.  Went anyway and the food cured me of all my frustrations. Only wished if I had gotten the duck that I saw on the other reviews instead of the fish as main course.  Overall we had a great experience there and definitely will come back when I visit London again.
"Chef Brett Graham's innovative cooking,
The two Michelin-starred restaurant opened in 2005 and has won many accolades: it’s rated among the top 50 restaurants in the world and is considered one of London’s very best. Featuring British produce and wild English game is the focus. Unfortunately it closed post Covid and reopened just one year ago. Serving is set menu."
"Had an absolutely fantastic lunch here just before Christmas. Service is awesome; friendly, helpful and unassuming. The food was fabulous; innovative, creative, excellent quality and great flavours. Highly recommended. Go now before they get their Michelin stars back!"
"I've been frequenting The Ledbury for years now - first time visiting since they reopened.

Love the new design and ambience, really glad that they kept the old team together. There is more of a Japanese take to the food here since the reopening.

Brett Graham is a legend. Food here is amazing. Thats all i have to say. I love this place."
"Happy that this restaurant reopened finally.
Incredible food based on innovative recipes. This restaurant truly deserves 3 stars and so far the best Michelin restaurants I have been in London (actually did not realize it was a 2 star restaurant while dining there 😂)."
"Phenomenal experience, the dishes are creative and delicious! We especially loved the Mushrooms from the Cabinet dish, very different and unique flavour but really nice! The atmosphere is beautiful, with a freshly renovated venue and lovely interior. Special thanks to the staff who served us Jessa, Yan, Lynn and Jack, all were very knowledgeable, sociable and friendly!"
"Amazing experience!
Wait staff operate like clockwork, just impressive to sit and watch them work. But they're also super friendly to talk to.
Place has a formal yet modern vibe to it, and this is reflected also in the food.
Great flavours, great ingredients, great drinks.
Make sure you visit the bathroom during yoir sitting, to see the mushroom fridge!"
"This restaurant definitely lives up to its fame - a Michelin two starred. Upon entry, you’d already be attracted by its fancy decorations and elegant ambience. Every dish served was a piece of artwork carefully cooked and presented. Though some of the taste were not my cup of tea. There were some in the Christmas set which I was truly in love with, such as the lobster soup(served cold), cod, and the lamb shoulder. Some food is best to be served cold so you can taste the most flavor out of it - perfectly demonstrated by the lobster soup. The cod was the finest cod I’ve had in London, very tender which made a great combination with the sauce. However, surprise never stopped in the Ledbury, the milk-fed lamb shoulder was super tender and flavorsome. I really hope that they had more of it on my plate(there was also lamb legs which was also tender but not as good as the shoulder). The Christmas tart was a nice combination of ginger and cinnamon, a good seasonal treat for the end of a nice Christmas meal. If you were to try the normal set, the brown sugar tart is a must try!!!
PS. One of my friend really appreciated their bread, and the restaurant gave us a whole loaf to take home for free!!! This pushed my expectation of ‘service’ to a whole new level. Well done!!!"
"Loved the whole experience, couldn't fault the execution and the atmosphere and venue were really excellent.  My personal preference and retrospective was that the truffle supplement (extra shavings over certain dishes) was not worth it - I think the dishes didn't need the extra...and I like truffle."
"Never thought about spending this much on a dinner, but this was definitely an experience I felt was worth it. Couldn't book it at regular dinner time, so we went at 945 pm, but since it's summer, it was still bright by the time we  started dinner. The staff are excellent at making you feel welcome. We were concerned we wouldn't have enough food since it was a fancy restaurant, but there are a few other courses included that weren't listed on the menus. By the end of the meal, we definitely felt full. Definitely worth it for a celebration dinner"
"Absolutely impeccable service, food and dining ambience. Very knowledgeable and friendly waiters, every dish was well-explained. The lamb shoulder, pork belly and lobster tail were incredibly delectable - my favourite dishes. There's no fault to find with The Ledbury. Simply wonderful."
"Best restaurant I've ever been to - we had a marvelous 8 course tasting menu and it was phenomenal from the service, to the flavors, and the ambiance.

We especially liked the lamb & mutton dish with a crispy potato roll and stuffed morel as well as the desserts of the mango millefeuille and kefir lime meringue, amazing.

Compared to CORE by Clare (the other tasting menu we had on our London trip) I thought Ledbury was better value and the dishes were better."
"Absolute gem of a restaurant. The tasting menu and wine pairing were spectacular, and the service was exceptional!"
"I have been there twice and each is amazing experience. It is impossible to convince myself that it has only two Michelin stars. Three or more would be a proper evaluation.

Anyway, sorry for the poor pictures I posted. Please see and savor their cuisine with your own senses."
"As good a meal as i've eaten in a long long time. The price point is high so only for those very special occasions but it delivered a memorable and truly delicious experience on our visit. The staff could not have been more charming, informative and considerate whilst the sommelier picked some great wine pairings for our meal. The high end modern European dining scene can be accused of pretentiousness and overdone formality but the atmosphere here was warm and inviting. For those who like modern European food this will surely delight and amaze."
"Sensational restaurant. Service was impecable, but also friendly, not like many other top restaurants where service can be quite stiff. Definitely go if you can."
"One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten in. From the first courses to the desserts. Top of the ingredients. Perfect cooking.  The service was super professional, and our waiter as well as the restaurant manager was full of humor and light-hearted. Same time Michelin restaurant is to match from every thing. Not this restaurant. I will be back  thanks for great experience"
"Cannot fault this restaurant at all. The service, the food, everything is on point. The staff are nice and very chatty which is nice and it’s not too stuffy that you don’t feel comfortable which I find with a lot of fine dining restaurants in UK. Not having a dress code yet the atmosphere is warm and very cosy. The presentation of food is what is expected of a fine dining restaurant, the taste is great. Loved executed dish expect for Deer. But it could be that I was already too full by the time I got there and I personally am not a fan of anything too Gamey in taste. The restaurant catered for my partners onion and garlic minor allergy by excluding it in his meal which is very nice as it’s sometimes quite hard to cater for that. Overall a very nice restaurant & would def go back when the menu is updated as it’s a degustation only so not much to choose from really but they do cater if there is a dish you don’t like and more than happy to swap it out."
Hands down best food I’ve had in London. Amazing flavours in every dish that made me go WOW. Inventive use of meat parts(tongue etc). Received a hand written card from the team to celebrate our birthday which was a nice touch! Vibe is quite formal. I am dreaming of the day I can come back for another visit!
"Impeccable from start to finish.  An experience to splurge on. The service was flawless and the food from the first canape bite to the last petite four was to die for.
Our sommelier was knowledgeable and the wine flight was beautiful.
I was so impressed with their attention to detail.  Thanks for a wonderful night."
"Simply a brilliant British fine dining restaurant in a quiet little corner in a London residential area.

Elegant spacious dining room. Had lunch there so large windows created  nice natural light. Service was attentive, knowledgeable and warm.

Dishes were tasty, unique but still very British.
Technique on each dish was very good. Plating was simple and neat.

Stand outs we the mackerel, pork cheek and brown butter cake was simply brilliant.

Wine list was extensive, and cheese board on offer had a great selection and well aged.

Reservations are recommended as this is one of the best restaurant in London right now.

A defined must go if you’re looking for a fine meal featuring British produce."
"I went to celebrate my birthday, on a Saturday night. I ordered the 8 course menu. The food is amazing, a truly chef's experience. The service is also incredible, very nice and perfect staff. We had an option for a 6 course, and to be honest that should had been my choice, because the two additional dishes were not worthy.
There was no music playing, and the restaurant was quite noisy, disturbing noisy. Also, the tables are too close to each other, some chairs standing 20 cm to each other. That mustn't be the case for the price of it."
"Our favourite restaurant in London. Very personalised, friendly & relaxed atmosphere & service. Guaranteed to be one of the best meals you'll have. Amazing customer service, they track your truffle addiction & will surprise you with extra complementary dishes 😋 We always book our next visit while we're mid-menu. You HAVE to go. Oh no, don't go, as that'll make it more difficult to get a table! 😉"
"This has to be up there with one of the best meals I have ever had. Fully deserves the Michelin stars and its excellent reputation. We had the four course set lunch with the wine pairings, and could not have asked for better quality. Knowledgeable and friendly staff without being overbearing. The food is truly out of this world, I could go on for days about the quality and incredible flavours. Can’t wait to come back one day."
Exceptional modern British cuisine with subtle Japanese nods and gracious/personable hospitality. A very generous tasting portion wise. Very much look forward to returning.
"Other than it's Michelin rating, impeccable service and welcoming staff. They treated us first timers as of we were regulars. Compliments to the kitchen of course as well, tasted flavors that I've ever experienced in my 40 years on earth."
"First off, the service was great - warm and friendly throughout. Atmosphere is nice if not a little uninspiring.

The reason for the ‘average’ 3 stars was the food. It was certainly good, but the mains were basic and nothing came across as ‘incredible’ for a £120 4-course meal, we expected more. My wife didn’t even finish her fish or pork - both she in essence lost interest in. First the first time ever at a Michelin restaurant, I added pepper to both mains for flavour.

On a positive note, all of the small in between courses were interesting, but again nothing outstanding. The desserts were both very good, mixing textures well - in fact they were what we expected each course to be like.

Maybe we had a unique experience, or the kitchen had an off night. But after our meal we would not recommend the Ledbury to friends given the quality and price."
"The venue is in a quiet residential area of Notting Hill.
Excellent ingredients cooked with excellent technique.
Services are good."
"Booking is required before you visit. I ate lunch course with 11 menus. Everything was incredibly delicious, especially the dessert and the main(today's is lamb) steak. They served with well balanced sause and I like the way they do platings. Staffs are very kind and care about every step of the course. Foods, mood, service, all the things in here were perfect. Highly recommend here."
"Delicious fine dining restaurant in the heart of Notting Hill. Superb modern British cuisine combining seasonal ingredients and beautiful flavours. Service in impeccable, and the full experience is just great. Really recommend going for the tasting menu - make sure to be hungry, as there's a lot of food, and give yourself a lot of time!"
"Wow what can I say! Overall the best overall restaurant experience I have had. Wonderful food, excellent matched wines, impeccable service. If I didn't live on the other side of the world will come back more!! Highly recommended for that special occasion or if you love good food and good service (and have money to burn!)"
"Every dish is impeccable. I had the oyster cream of Chantilly, cod, lobster wrapped in shiitake, and the brown sugar tart as dessert.

The cream of Chantilly was refreshing and holds all the flavors. The cod was cooked to perfection. And I was surprised by the use of tapioca in the sauce and yet it accompanied the fish very well. My favorite was the lobster. I’ve never thought it goes so will the the shiitake. The mushroom tasted like the sun dried ones and added a trace of bitter sound flavor to the lobster. Such food pairing is not even common in Eastern Asian dishes. The brown sugar tart tastes like creme brûlée and the best part of the dessert is the stem ginger ice cream. It’s spicy to the exact right strength.

The service is attentive the nice. I don’t mind if it’s a bit more casual."
"Worth your hard earned money! Service is impeccable! The food, well the experience is memorable and the dishes are flawless. There is no music in the background and it's an airy feel where every seat is good. Very much recommended."
Impeccable from start to finish. An experience to splurge on. The service was flawless and the food from the first canape bite to the last petite four was to die for. Our sommelier was knowledgeable and the wine flight was beautiful. Food perfect. Cheese trolley exquisite. Special meal.
"The birthday experience had been fantastic where they even gave a birthday card and an additional dessert. It is a little far of travel by tube. However, if you drive, there are street parking fairly close to the restaurant. (If you drive, you can’t have the wine pairing, don’t drink and drive!)

We had the dinner tasting menu. Food quality is very high where our favourite dish is the Hen in the wood. Just the smoke rosemary is brought out with the mushroom where the smoke is a little disturbing to others who are not yet on that course. It can hinder your sense of smell that affects the dining experience.

Another downside is that the white beetroot with smoke eel was a little disappointing. The balance was a little off towards the sweet side. Perhaps this is due to personal taste.

The atmosphere is nice, service had been spectacular. Just some minor things that can be improved. I.e. a female staff wore a very very fragrant hand cream and a different scent in the hair. Another male staff had explained dishes to another table with his bottom pointing towards my face. Some staff touch your chair when they walk past.

Overall:
Quality of food: 9.5/10
Surprise factor: 7.5/10
Service: 8/10
Location: 7/10
Experience: 8/10
Value of money: 7/10
Likelihood to return: Possibly

PS the coffee at the end (at an extra cost) is very delicious"
Finest fine dining in London. 5 star experience. Amazing service and meal.
Very nice loacation and excellent food. We had lunch and really enjoyed all the dishes. We were treated like royalty and they made us feeling like home. Thank you.
"What stood out about this 2-star restaurant was the exceptionally slick service that didn't miss a beat during the entire meal. Not a single hitch during the entire 3-4 hour dinner. The staff was excellent and service friendly, which is what you expect when you go to this kind of restaurant. The sommelier however took this up another notch which is always fun to experience. Well done!

My wife has a couple of allergies like fish and nuts. This was handled expertly by the restaurant. They even replaced the wine for a dish which is rare to see. Usually the restaurant will simply replace a couple of ingredients in the dish and service the same wine but as the sommelier explained this would have ruined the dish. Top marks!

What was unusual for me was that this is not a ""tasting menu only"" restaurant. Several tables in our vicinity had a four course meal instead. However, I would absolutely recommend the tasting menu if you are going here for the first time. You'd be missing out otherwise!

I found the overall quality of the dishes to be excellent but perhaps a bit on the safe side. This is not a bad thing but don't go here if you want a lot of surprises. The standout dish for me was the Warm Bantam’s Egg with truffles."
Great dishes always (both flavours and presentations). We visited on a Birthday so we had a surprise dessert. Very friendly staff. Generous to provide alternative options main course to accommodate dietary restrictions.
Celebrated my fiancés 30th birthday here with the 8 course tasting menu with wine package. Recommended highly. Food was incredible and wine pairs immensely well.
"Supreme dining experience. We had 8 course tasting menu. Very satisfactory and my taste buds are excited.  I like the scallop with asparagus, lobster meat and lamb in particular. Very friendly service and ambience. Highly recommended."
Still one of my favorite dining experiences in London.  The quality of the cookery seems more refined than before and ultimately very enjoyable. Modern French albeit sourcing the best British ingredients. Service was super friendly and very knowledgeable about food in general.
Only my second time at the Ledbury and it didn’t disappoint. Innovative cuisine which changes on a regular basis unlike a lot of other Michelin starred restaurants. Not a large restaurant so be sure to book in advance.
Amazing meal. Great service. Had a blust. Would love to come back again.
"Staff was amazing. It seemed like there was one staff member for each customer.

Food was intricate, colourful, delicious, perfectly plated, and paired with the perfect wine.

Absolutely worth every penny."
"I have been to this fine establishment for a total of four times – three in 2017 (Feb, May, Dec) and recently in July this year.

What makes the Ledbury stand out for me is first, the food – great local (mostly) ingredients and a wonderful palate of flavours that work, whilst being complex enough to provide a bit of mystery. It feels like a true mastery of the craft, there has not been any weird experimental dishes to work through!

Next is the consistency – not only course to course on the same day, but through all my visits. Everything from the seasoning, temperature, plating has been just right.

The service, impeccable. Front of house is just as professional as you’d expect, to the serving of the dishes and drinks, whilst remaining a bit of informal rapport – strikes a great balance, feels just about right.

Last but definitely not least, is the best sommelier for me in London – Seamus @seamussharkey. Every time I am here, there is always a fantastic spread of wines from all over the world, most of which I won’t ever even come in contact with otherwise! The man has a deep knowledge and is always pursuing for more.. I definitely feel a bit more educated with every meal.

Whenever going to the Ledbury, I am able to let go and let the restaurant take care of me. No disappointments, fabulous food and wine that always slightly exceeds expectations with great people that makes me feel welcome on every occassion. This is what a dining experience should be, and a great standard that restaurants should be striving for."
Exceptional. Nothing more I can say that hasn't been said by people far more talented than I.
"5* for the experience, staff friendliness/interaction/knowledge and variety of tastings on the menu.

The atmosphere is much more relaxed and improved than a previous visit 9yrs when it was all quite quiet. There was a nice buzz to the place.

The tasting menu (only option on Saturday evening) was interesting and varied. The oyster/egg and cod were the highlight for me.

Wine list was varied, plenty menu f new world wines there. It would have been nice to see some more in the £50-75 range.  But I suspect the usual visitors here perhaps that’s not such a concern.

£388 for two inc service, 8 course tasting each, 2x glass of white, 1 x bottle of red."
"Excellent dinner flawlless service !
Everytime I have great time in Ledbury , nothing less than I expect defently I ll dine again.
thanks all the staff front a back of the house !"
"My partner and I are both people who live to eat. In 2019 we back we had our first top tier dining experience at La Petite Colombe and it brought us so much joy and amazement that it became a priority of ours to save up for another special dining experience once every year or two. But then covid hit, many places shut down and I unfortunately got diagnosed with allergies to gluten, dairy, and soy. For years I really thought that my experience in 2019 would be my last chance to eat at a top tier restaurant. I couldn't imagine that any restaurant would be willing to work around my restrictions. Surely if they would, the versions they would create for me would be pale, tasteless facsimiles of the regular dish.

That's why I was floored by how accommodating The Ledbury was about my restrictions. I gave them a call before booking and was greeted with pure enthusiasm and not a touch of judgment. The incredibly nice hostess even called me back to ask for a clarification which I very much appreciated.

The evening and the food were wonderful. From the numerous amuse bouches to the last sweet bite of desert everything was beautiful and tasted great. Not only did they work around my restrictions, they created alternates that were just as delicious, interesting, and gorgeous to look at as the dishes from the normal menu.  The food itself was incredible. Every bite was a journey of discovery - new combinations of flavors and textures that we had no idea existed. Delicate bright notes of citrus and salt swimming over scrumptious notes of umami and fat. For my partner's birthday they also adorned our table with a sweet card which was a great touch. I'd be remiss to not mention the friendly and warm staff who made us feel very welcome as they conducted us through a magical evening.

I'm deeply grateful to The Ledbury, not just for the wonderful evening, but also for showing me realize that top tier dining is still possible for me with my restrictions."
"The Ledbury has fallen somewhat out-of-vogue but I was thoroughly impressed with nearly every dish. A truly excellent restaurant, flavours are well-considered and service is exemplary."
"It is a real pleasure to dine at the Ledbury, fitting of its Michelin stars. Definitely recommended. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of central London, it is in a quiet neighbourhood of Notting Hill and I really love the quiet atmosphere of coming to and leaving the restaurant.

Have visited this restaurant since 2012 and you do notice some subtle changes. Nowadays you have to have the tasting menu at night so there is no choice there and the a la carte menu is only available at lunch time. They also used to have a lovely choice of breads and rolls but now it is just one type of bread. It's the little things that you notice ""slipping"". The two other things are, I'm sure the spelling on the menu is Olive Oil and not Olive Oli.

There was a nice little Happy anniversary card on our table as it was an anniversary dinner but for some reason, the card was dated a few days earlier and not the actual date of our dinner. It's strange but it highlights what I have noticed about the restaurant ""changing"" subtly.

Service is faultless. One of them even noticed that I just love their soughdough breadcrusts and brought me more without having to ask which is highly commendable. As I prefer the a la carte menu more, I think The Ledbury is the place to be for lunch."
"The food was fantastic and had an amazing dining experience, topped up with exceptional service. Thank you for making my Birthday and our London visit special"
"Excellent service & the most tender beef I have had maybe ever. Delicious amuse bouses . Honestly , I am not writing much because my experience at the Ledbury was simply so good , I think it is superfluous to write so much . Come and experience it for yourself . Truly lives up to its 2 Michellin stars . I am so happy I came here for dinner on my last night in London."
"Unfortunately Not a great experience, despite the price waitress was kind of snobby and did not pay much attention. Food also was in the majority tasteless. That’s a pity for a well recognised restaurant like this one."
"Super nice place to go. I went for the Lunch set menu, very imaginative British cuisine at its best. Staff even took out raw ingredient to explain my questions."
"2 Michelin stars and voted number 14 in the world's best restaurants - its not hard to see why. I don't claim to be an expert in Michelin dinning, but you can instantly feel the difference when you go through the doors. Staff are attentive, knowledgeable and considerate. They are there to offer any assistance they can and are not at all pretentious.

This place is in such high demand that if you're lucky enough to get a reservation, you might as well go all out and try the tasting menu with the wine pairing. This is what we did and we were not disappointed. Each dish was dressed well and carefully crafted. Some even played with your mind, looking like a something, but being the complete opposite. Regardless, all were well received and I was pleasantly surprised.

It's completely wheelchair accessible too so I can't fault them in any way. This is great if you wanted to treat yourself to quality good food. It would be a regular of mine if I could afford it. The souvenir card, which included details of what you had eaten, was a nice touch at the end."
What an experience!  Had dinner with friends  and enjoyed every second of the meal. Get the wine paring for sure - the staff is super knowledgeable about every detail. Food was beyond delicious and kept you wanting more!  Can’t wait to go back next time we are in London!
"A fantastic tasting menu. The flavours were exceptional, and the wine pairings spot on. This place gives certain 3 star Michelin restaurants a run for their money!"
"Amazing meal, perfect for a special occasion, could not fault anything. Simply one of the best restaurants in the country!
All the team were superb, thankyou for an amazing experience!"
"Had lunch here. Amazing food and very good staff. Felt like a special guests, nice personal approach. Would definitely come back again."
I loved the experience. The only complaint is that there are too many pre-apps so the 8 course menu ended up being a bit too much food! We finished everything and it was delicious.
"It was very good experience during my london trip. Foods were good, people are kind and young. Not that traditional, to me, it was more young and casual."
"This restaurant is really special. The service is simply the best. Food is creative, tasty, incredibly presented. There is a reason that it has two Michelin Stars. Has to be experienced to believe."
"Top 3 in London, and absolutely no.1 for game cookery in London if not the UK. Forget about Gordon Ramsay at Hospital Road or Alain Ducasse at Dorchester. Best service in London and amongst the best Somms."
The staff is friendly and informative. We have a great experience there. The menu is creative and we discover new flavor from their dish.
"2 Michelin Stars.
Worlds 50 Best Restaurants.
Voted best restaurant by Zagat London."
"Most amazing meal money can buy. Everything was spot on. Food, wine and service. Simply amazing"
Absolutely stunning in every regard. We went at the weekend which means you have to have one of the tasting menus. Can't wait to go back!
"Impeccable service, food & wine. Amazing vegetarian tasting menu. Everything you could wish for in a special occasion meal."
"What an experience. The tasting menu was divine, the service was out of this world and the whole evening was a joy. A friend of ours had the vegetarian tasting menu and for once almost had an identical menu to the non veg as they made slight adjustments to the dishes. The sommeliers were fantastic and very friendly. We also got the chance to meat the chef and kitchen crew who were professional and welcoming. Thank you for the hospitality. I'm sure I'll be back!"
"So good. Incredible service without being stuffy, creative and fresh foods to keep it exciting, and one of the best wine pairings I've had. Not cheap, but worth it if you can get a seat."
The eight course tasting menu was delicious. Definately one of the best Michelin restaurants I've been too (aside from Sketch). The only thing I found lacking comparing the two was the ambience. The Ledbury was quite casual for a two Michelin star.
"We had an extra night to spend in London before flying home and decided.to have a nice dinner. We chose The Ledbury based on reviews and we were not disappointed!

We had the vegetarian tasting menu (with one course modified for me since I don't like beets) along with the paired wines.

The food was great. The wines were a treat and matched each course perfectly. The staff was fabulous. The meal was an amazing experience that served as an exclamation point on our adventure in Europe.

We particularly enjoyed the very creative vegetarian courses. All were delicious and beautifully presented.

The meal was not inexpensive, but worth every penny! We are looking forward to the time when we can visit again."
"Fantastic experience!! Of course the food is outstanding and the fit out beautiful, however it was the staff that made this one of my fave fine dining experiences in London. Brett Graham is such a top bloke, down to earth, and made the effort to meet every table at the start of the meal. All the staff were so easy going, fun and accommodating. Totally recommend!"
"Well deserved Michelin stars. The food is amazing, innovative and creative. Flavors and aromas well blended. Good wine selection. And really friendly but professional service."
This restaurant with excellent food  drink and great and friendly staff I recommend visiting this place for a nice and relaxing meal and enjoy this food
Excellent to have them back.  2 Michelin Stars will certainly return too.
"I don’t understand how this restaurant has 3 Michelin stars, I left there I was still hungry and the dishes were very poor, we bring a client in there he was upset at the end of the night, the service and the location is nice but it’s a no"
"Services were great. But I think it’s a bit overpriced for this quality.
But overall, this is a very warm and nice experience👍🏻 …"
"I have been the Ledbury second time but it was not reach to expectation food wise .
It not as great as before unfortunately."
An unbelievable restaurant in every way. A little slice of heaven in Notting Hill. From the service to the dishes and drinks there is care for every detail. A truly memorable experience.
"It’s giving you Michelin 2 stars without disappointment. Definitely try it if you haven’t been to a Michelin restaurant before, it’ll give you a good start."
"This place is generally accepted to be one of the best restaurants in London for a very good reason; everything was exemplary. Food, service, decor - fairly reasonably priced as well.

One of the courses was quite honestly one of the most memorable I've ever had (and I've had one or two over the years), all neatly wrapped up with a cracking beer selection.

Will definitely be returning."
"I loved it. The food, the place, the wine and the waiters were super kind"
"One of the best restaurants in UK!
Been there at lunch time and the food is absolutly amazing!!!"
"Thank you so very much for one of the best (if not THE best) restaurant experiences of our very long lives!
Everything was perfection. The welcome, the service, the attention to detail, the food!

First I’ll enthuse over that meal. Every delicious bite seemed to be an explosion of flavors…combinations we hadn’t had before that surprised and delighted.
The multiple & wondrous amuse-bouche, the marvelous mains, the dessert(s) which included two that acknowledged our anniversary and my birthday.
Each course--- all sensational and the work, I believe, of a remarkable culinary genius.

Last, but not least, I’ll mention the service. In a word extraordinary. Warmth- from the entire staff all of whom went above and beyond. One stunning example…we had mentioned to one person that we were on a four month “retirement"" tour (Bath, Dartmouth, York & Rye). A bit later he dropped off a notecard with hand written restaurant recommendations for each of those locations!! We so very much appreciated this exceptional and thoughtful kindness.

Thank you, thank you to all at the Ledbury!!!"
We had been wanting to come for a long time and finally got a reservation. The two of us had the tasting menu. Booked again for next year ...this says it all.
"Beautiful restaurant with great good, great wine selections and great service!!! Had a great lunch here."
"I will say this - from the second I walked in, staff at The Ledbury made me truly feel like I was worthy of being there, regardless of the clothes I was wearing and my background. None of that mattered. I BELONGED. .

Rather than cool indifference or even worse, simpering, suffocating servitude, I was connected with humorously and authentically by staff who were instantly familiar and unashamedly down to earth, which in turn put every guest at ease. .

Every single person in the room was on the same level and it was a moment of rare beauty that I, til date, had not observed in all the top restaurants I've dined at over the years.

You can see the full range of dishes eaten on the YouTube channel.

"Amazing dinner at the Ledbury - everything was fantastic from the service to the ambiance to the wine list and of course, the food. I’m so happy to have dined here on my birthday and look forward to coming back."
"Just so so. We chose the 8 courses set meal and have 3 bottles of wine, £320 per person. Not worth the price at all."
The food and service were absolutely amazing. Definitely worth what you pay.
"I had been meaning to visit since before lockdown and finally ate here for my birthday last year. One of the best tasting menus I've had the pleasure of experiencing combined with maybe the best service around. All the flavours and dishes were top notch and clearly deserving of the Michelin stars it recently regained since reopening. I would definitely go back, which isn't something I usually think about a place like this"
"We went there for a family lunch of 4 people. The moment from the entrance being greeted by the manager to our departure, the service was excellent... Except for a small hiccup.
They were very slow in asking us if we wanted coffee or tea at the end of the meal. So much so, that when I asked for the bill, they quickly asked us if we wanted them while immediately gave us the ""petits fours"".
The food was well prepared with excellent presentation and a lot of complexity.

The environment is very nice. The tables are far from each other. The room is bright without being excessive. Even the washroom is well supplied with real towels, not paper towels.

All in... un restaurant digne de porter les étoiles Michelin.
Continuez, bravo!"
Excellent restaurant. The food is good and unique. The service great
"Thank your for an amazing dining experience! I've had The Ledbury on my list for almost a decade now, but it was worth the wait. I chose the restaurant to celebrate my 40th birthday with my mum and it definitely exceeded expectations; especially the service. We are both not short of fine dining experiences, but this one stands out for sure. Not only did we love the interior, every single dish was delicious and when they realized that I was translating the details of the dishes to my mum they translated and printed the full menu just for her. Outstanding! Every staff member wished me 'Happy Birthday!', a hand-written card was already awaiting me when we sat down and I even got an extra dessert. And I haven't even mentioned the amounts of truffle yet. Thank you for making celebrating this milestone with my mum special!"
Love the food and the wine pairing. I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was sensational! One of my favourite restaurants in London.
"The Ledbury really is worth a visit to forget about the outside world and to be spoilt and enjoy some fantastic plates of food.
One feature to this restaurant is that all the tables have a great view next too the large windows.
We started the meal with a glass of champagne with an abundant selection of canapés.The high lights of the meal for me being the chalk stream trout with shiso and the muntjac dear….the grated heart on a piece of aubergine was so creamy and smoky and the dumpling  to with hints of spruce.
We finished the meal with some blackcurrant pastille rolled in some exotic sugar that my brain has erased and the classic chocolate truffle all elevated with the Ledbury twist.
We also had the pleasure to meet Brett and thank him for looking after ourselves and our son who had been before.
One member of staff of note was Josh who was a pleasure to be served by….keep doing what you do….and thank you."
"nice food,  nice service,  but a bit rush if you go for second round dinner"
This place is so heartwarming with a great hospitality and delicious dishes. Highly recommended!
Nice atmosphere and friendly service. A bit surprise for the birthday bit. Recommended!

"Highly recommend this place for vegetarians looking for an edible Michelin star meal with depth and flavor.

I took my cousin there for his 30th birthday. Incredible and memorable experience. Amazing menu. Apart from the sour cream ice-cream, pretty much everything else on the menu was spot on. Incredibly creative and delicious. Vegetarian food was not an after-thought. Rather, it was given its due place and the chefs had whipped up some incredibly creative dishes. Some crazy ones included their Brioche with Wild garlic. Goat milk butter (?). Morel mushrooms with asparagus. Canale (?) with almond powder. The incredible Isle of Wight tomato dishes. And when we were leaving they even gave us a gift -- a huge loaf of bread they had baked.

And a special mention of the staff. Extremely warm people. We didn't get the name of the two gentlemen who served us - one was in a suit (was perhaps from Salamanca?) and the other was in a white coat with an apron. They were extremely friendly and really added to the entire experience."
"We had a really lovely time celebrating our paper anniversary together. They made the occasion truly special for us, even going so far as to give us a menu signed by all the waiters and kitchen staff which we’ve kept to remind us of our celebratory dinner! As tasting menus go, this was probably the best we’ve had in London. I’m sure they’ll get their Michelin stars back in the near future having re-opened post Covid. Can’t wait to return!"

"Went for a friends birthday, theybinly have a testers menu.
Creative menu, friendly and professional staff."
"Based on the New integration post covid
I really like this place.  The new revamp is fantastic.  Great and friendly service.
The service was attentive and friendly - they also judged the interaction really well they were warm and nice to us, and you could see they were more formal with another table.  That is a very hard skill.
The food was of course Michelin star - but had a positive flair to it, more than just foam.
Highly recommend and will be back

"Absolutely brilliant experience! The food was incredible, the service was so incredibly warm, friendly and engaging and the ambiance was perfection. We waited a long time to eat here and it was soooo worth it! We highly recommend the wine pairing with the tasting menu! Superb!!"
"Incredible ambience, all staff were knowledgeable and engaging, each dish was impeccable and the manager is fantastic. A superior dining experience."
"We went for a lunch and it was such an amazing experience.  From the mushrooms that they grow in house to the impeccable service it was outstanding.   It’s not cheap, but if you’re celebrating a special occasion or want to treat someone special, I couldn’t recommend a visit here enough.  A real
5 star experience"
"Exceptional meal, our second time at The Ledbury and it was just as good as the first. The service was perfect, the food was incredible and the new layout of the restaurant is welcoming and relaxed!"
My husband and I had dinner Feb 3rd for our anniversary. A congratulations card awaited on the table when we arrived.  Gorgeous tasting menu with a number of delicious extras. Staff was friendly and unpretentious. Setting was stylish and relaxing. Looking forward to our next visit!
"Very pleasant experience with great company. Good friends birthday dinner celebrations. The 8 course set menu was yummy, but, we were not able to finish the last meal."
This restaurant definitely lives up to its fame. One of the best restaurants in UK!. Went for a lunch and it was such an amazing experience.
"Writing this review for my friend. The occasion was to celebrate her birthday, and I sent the cake to the restaurant beforehand. At first they claimed they didn’t receive the cake, and took a long while of communication to figure out actually they did receive the cake which I felt they were very disorganised.

At the end of the dinner, when the staff brought over the cake they removed a personalised information that had the “happy birthday + name” sign which was obviously needed to be presented.

Because they didn’t communication beforehand about my friend’s name, when singing the birthday song they didn’t know who was celebrating. This obviously looked very bad and ruined the surprise and experience for my friend.

Overall the food was great but the professionalism of the hospitality needs to be improved especially for people who come to the restaurant for special occasion, hoping a special night but m take home with disappointing experience."
"Finally, it is reopened. We absolutely loved the new menu. Crab entree, the mushroom plate and the vanilla custard were the highlights of the tasting menu for us. Chef Brett is such a humble and friendly person that he welcomes all his guests seperately and that treats them like the stars of the night, while in reality he is one. His technique, plating and matching choices are all flawless.
The staff’s approach to the guests is also worth noting; disciplined but genuinely welcoming at the same time. In brief, we are so glad to see Ledbury back to London’s fine dining scene."
"Having been to many Michelin star and other fine dining restaurants around the world, I can safely say that the Ledbury is one of the best restaurants in the world.  The food is delicious and innovative, and service is excellent!"
"Food was amazing but i mean can not believe that they served with this plate ,,it is two Michelin stars restaurant,, a bit disappointed"
"Wow, still one of the best in the UK. Not been for a while but must say the staff were charming and service was excellent on my recent visit. The food on the tasting menu was delivered in perfectly timed intervals and was simply amazing. Very clever dishes such as beetroot & smoked eel with caviar salt were a dream combination and a masterful mix of flavours! Every mouthful was a pleasure and they even made a special Birthday dessert for my partner. If you have not been, it’s time to go and experience one the best restaurants in the UK today!"
"Went here with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. We could not have left this place being happier.

We chose the 7 course taster menu, every single meal was delicious and had a lovely design to it. The waiter we had was very nice and helpful. he explained every dish to us and made our entire experience pleasant.

the customer service at this place is one of the best and i would highly recommend this restaurant."
"We had the pleasure of having our anniversary at this lovely restaurant tonight.
Everything from start to finish was just perfect.
No rush, everything  was  done in a casual way but with a very subtle attention to detail.
2 sommelier through the 8 course tasting menu taking you through the wines.
Every course was just stunning.
The atmosphere was chilled and the staff only came to your table when they needed to.
A special mention to Jeremy who went above and beyond what he needed to.
On leaving the restaurant he presented us with a lovely reminder of our night with a gift we didn’t expect.
A lovely gesture.
Thank you for a lovely evening.

"We had the 8 course tasting menus (two of us got regular, one got veg and one had dietary requirements). Attentive service who were very flexible with dietary requirements. While I didn't find any course in particular outstanding apart from perhaps the pre-dessert, everything we were served was consistently good/excellent. Bread was excellent and I could probably have finished it had we not had so much food! It's an experience. As is the risk with tasting menus, you won't like everything. Would recommend, though. I think it doesn't quite live up to the hype but it suits people who like 'modern European' rather than bold flavours. I really liked the beetroot dish as well."
Absolutely our top restaurant experience in London! Fine dining on the next level. Epic food and service... the one is lost without the other. Fantastic atmosphere too. We are treated like royalty and yet also made to feel “right at home”. Thank you for the best dining experience which will be hard to beat...
"One of our best dining experiences. The service was spot on and every course of the tasting menu was delicious, innovative and absolutely beautiful. The wine pairings worked perfectly. This restaurant deserves all the praise it receives and more."
"My experience at ""The Ledbury"" was beyond compare.
The staff was very attentive and professional,and the food was simply ecstatic.
I went fro the tasting menu with wines,and i was not disappointed.
everything was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned...and with certainty the cornish cod on the tasting menu was the best dish i ever had in my life.
Never before had such ecstatic food and such great service all in one night.
I am really rooting for their 3rd star"
"This was our first time at The Ledbury and expectations were high, having had a number of rave reviews from other people who'd been. We were not disappointed. Food and ambience were very good and the service was outstanding. From the moment we walked in until the moment we were shown into a taxi to go home, we could not have been better looked after. Hyped, but worth it. We'll be back."
Incredible experience. The only item that was difficult to digest was the bill!
"I have just had dinner here with my young daughter. We both absolutely loved the food....honestly it was flawless, both in terms of presentation and taste....that Brown Sugar Tart....sweet Jesus ....its perfect. The front of house staff were just the best, I was truly touched at the kindness they extended to my daughter. Don't know if you guys read these reviews, tbh I don't really like writing them, but I wanted to say thank you once again, for giving us such a memorable evening........my daughter literally floated out of your restaurant on a happy, warm, fuzzy cloud. Thank you for the outstanding food, and for your thoughtful kindness."
"This restaurant is the height of sophistication. If  the French cuisine is your passion, you will love this place. I had great first impressions. The service was flawless. What about the food? It was served in a very attractive way and was extraordinarily tasty. The wine was well balanced and with rich flavour. I had a very nice experience."
"My 4th visit after a 6 year break. The menu has moved on as I expected (and hoped) but quality of food was just as amazing as I remember. We had the tasting menu with wine pairing and was simply blown away by the skill. This is still the best fine dining restaurant in London for me. The food has the feel of something authentically constructed with love, whilst others can seem over productionised. Maybe this is because they don't try to cram in loads of guests, it is a relatively small restaurant but I love intimate feel of the space."
"The Ledbury returns better than ever.
The dining room is enhanced,. a more pleasing layout. Nowhere in London matches  attention to detail. Service is impeccable. The food is totally exceptional.
I love it."
"One the best Michelin starred restaurants I have ever been, though I have been over 20 Michelin stars and even though the Ledbury is absolutely not a tiny and a boutique one like the most.  We were two and had a tasting menu for the dinner. The service was extremely good; helpful, informed, attentive without being intrusive and the staff were able to being friendly as well by avoiding being too formal. We were asked if we had any allergies or dislikes. The dishes were no doubtfully amazing with nice combinations of pureed green vegetables, delicious scallop with frozen horseradish, fish, duck and lamb. Overall, it is an unforgettable dining experience."
"Such a beautiful experience with excellent food and a great service. Delightful dishes, I was excited for each dish and each one exceeded expectations."
It's not often an experience lives up to such high expectations. There is a reason this place is as well reviewed as it is. The food by the incredible chefs overseen by Head Chef Brett is exquisite. The wine bought and paired by Seamus is divine. Every staff member we came in contact with were knowledgeable with the love of their work shining through. This place is for special occasions and we'll be going again.
"This restaurant is stunning. Classical simple  decor is perfect setting for the food you are about to experience. There is no doubt why this has 2 Michelin star and is one of the best restaurants in the world.
The food was absolutely stunning and kept giving little surprises along the way. I would defiantly go for the tasting menu with wine pairing. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and took you on a journey each time a new dish and wine arrived. All the staff were very friendly and made you feel welcome to ensure you have the best experience. The cocktails and drinks are a little expensive and can easily add to the bill which will be at the high end range. An Old Fashioned cost around £18 each but like everything here it was amazing!"
"Probably the best dining experience of my life. Food that covers every texture, taste, sight, and smell. Service that is impeccable. I've never had a restaurant experience like this and probably won't for a while! The tasting menu is 100% worth it. Though towards the end of the meal I was struggling with the amount of food is eaten. Fantastic restaurant."
Incredible food for a very special night out!  The sommelier was super knowledgeable and took a lot of time to talk us through the wines we tasted.
The best food I've ever had. The flow from course to course was seamless taking you on a fantastic journey. It was very fun anticipating the route that you would head in. The matched wines - delicious. Everything was perfect. I cannot fault the experience I had at The Ledbury.
"The Ledbury just never fails.  I've been coming here for years when looking for a special treat and they always go above and beyond.  Being a quite ""particular"" eater, I often find fine dining a struggle, with haughty chefs and staff disdaining or outright refusing to accommodate food preferences; The Ledbury couldn't be more gracious about it.  Having catalogued my preferences over the years, they outdid themselves with the tasting menu yesterday.  While my companion happily dined on the standard tasting menu, every one of my courses took my preferences into consideration and was adapted accordingly.  I might have been embarrassed by the extreme effort that went into this, if I wasn't so busy enjoying every exquisite bite.  All of this was accompanied by wonderful wines selected with the sage advise of the sommelier.  Beyond the quality of the food and wine, the whole staff are just on another level of excellent (special shout out to Darren and Jeremy).  It's true it's a pricey experience, not intended for daily dining, but I've never left feeling even a penny short of delighted.  Thank you to the whole Ledbury team for another wonderful visit."
"What a fantastic place. As would expect, the food was wonderful. We came for Valentine's Day, and had the 8 course tasting menu. Each course was lovely, especially the pork and fish dishes. The menu came with plenty of delightful canapés too. The thing that really separates this from other fine dining restaurants is the quality of the service. I don't think there is anywhere like it, the staff we beyond friendly. Highly recommend!"
"Came here for a lunch with a group of friends. Service was great, patient and explained every dish. The waiter was ok to replace some stuff on the menu as my friend was allergic to dairy. We didn’t order wine and still had good service.

The food was pretty good, everyone liked every single dish served."
"Perfect restaurant!
We had a nice family dinner here for my father's birthday. The menu offers a thing for everyone and they also have a very wide selection of quality wines. We had the tasting menu and my personal favourite from there was the roast scallops. It was the highlight of the dinner for me, even though everything was delicious and prepared with only fresh ingredients. The dishes were also presented in very unique and special way. Additionally the staff are all very friendly and polite.
The Ledbury is an excellent restaurant for special occasions, even if the food is a bit pricey."
Really good food. Nice atmosphere - not too stuffy or pretentious. Staff were excellent. Very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu.
London has a lot of good restaurants and this is one of the greatest.  Everything is so refined and well done but not pretentious or precious.  Exceptional service with great guidance through the seasonal menu.  A deep and varied wine list as one would expect but it features great bottles at entry as well as top level.  Everyone how loves eating must eat here once.
"I had the pleasure of visiting The Ledbury on Saturday night for a special birthday dinner. It was incredible from start to finish and deserves its fame. The food was superb, the best meal we've ever had. Fantastic wine and cocktail selection, and the service was friendly and faultless. Thank you to Dylan and his team."
Couple of friends have recommended this place to us and it certainly does not disappoint. Delicate flavours and authentic use of ingredients. I had the set lunch and my husband had a la carte 4-course meal. Portion size is just right and food does not feel too heavy.
"Amazing food, great service and the prices advertised include service too - always a pleasant surprise!

PS. They catered fantastically for my girlfriend who is coeliac, substituted certain ingredients/dishes within the tasting menu and offered some great gluten free bread too.

Fully recommend!!"
"Incredible dining experience in a friendly environment. One of the best restaurants in the world, definitely my favourite in London, the dishes are full of surprises and are exceptionally crafted. What makes this place stand out is also the quality and friendliness of the service that you don't find anywhere else. Also note that service included in the prices."
An amazing dining experience from start to finish. The food was superb and the staff was excellent. If you are looking for one of the best dining experiences in London this is it. Also this is no quick meal. Our meal took around 3 delicious hours.
"Update 25.09.17:

It has been few years since I have been to the Ledbury and I have to say it is still top. The food I feel is even better than on my last visit and the service as attentive as always.

This restaurant is one of the top restaurants in the world for a reason! Anybody who is lucky to get a table should definitely come and try it out for yourself you will not regret it (well not at least until you get the bill ^^)

Ps: and if you do get a chance try to say hello to the kitchen team and chef graham they deserve a big thank you too!

Old review 2015:

Booked for my birthday and it was the first time I ever visited a 2 star michelin star restaurant.

I have to say I do really enjoyed the whole experience. The service was definitely one of the best I have ever experienced. The presentation of the food was also very nice.

We had the tasting menu and the lamb was probably the best I ever had in my life.

The only nick picking would be that a fruit fly landed into my wine glass but a staff member was helpful enough to fish it out for me.

For sure a restaurant worth visiting and recommending.

Cheers!"
"I was treated to a vegetarian 4 course lunch for my birthday. The service was impeccable, the food was stunning (the nicest vegetarian food I've ever had), and a surprise birthday dessert was brought out to top off an already incredible meal. As if the afternoon couldn't get any better, we were then asked if we wanted to meet Brett Graham, and of course we did! Brett was incredibly friendly and down to earth, and on top of everything else, this incredibly nice gesture made this a truly unforgettable afternoon. I can't wait to come back!"
"Absolutely stunning restaurant and food. We had the vegetarian tasting menu and every course was utterly delectable, particularly the woodland hen mushroom. Service was impeccable - polite, attentive but personable. Thoroughly recommend"
"We dined here on March 8 2020, and it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Often on a tasting menu you can have one or two misses, but each dish was more delicious than the last. What really makes The Ledbury stand out, however, is the staff. The servers, sommelier, bar staff, and manager do everything in their power to make you feel comfortable and welcome. The service is incredible. It is extremely classy without being stuffy. I wanted to substitute more reds in the wine pairing and the sommelier made it happen without hesitation. Also my low-dairy menu was incredible. The Ledbury sets the standard for what a special night out should be. Thank you."
"Went there for a lunch with some good friends. Ordered the set menu which was very cheap for a Michelin star restaurant.
The location, the restaurant setting and the service were all great.
The food was beautifully presented. However, the starter could have less oil on the plate. This is the sole reason of not having a five star review here."
"this is like food, but with different tasting! Not every dish taste the samey!  Some of them are different, but each had Tasteward to the Windows!  A brilliant and innovatively way .. Hooray!  You will eat there again one day"
"Incredible food and service from a very welcoming, knowledgable team who never stop and work extremely hard  to make sure the experience is flawless.
The atmosphere is very relaxed, and you can forget you are in London as you are taken on a wonderful foodie journey.
We enjoyed the tasting menu for lunch which I would definitely recommend, but we were torn between the set lunch menu and the four course lunch menu, both looked fantastic and they present the set menu first which was nice not to be made to feel like one should have the tasting menu. We will definitely revisit."
"I like that The Ledbury is on a quiet residential street in Notting Hill - it's definitely the sort of place you'd seek out for a special occasion, rather than an average midweek meal out.

Unsurprisingly, the food is really very good. We kicked things off with bread rolls, including a bacon and red onion brioche that blew my mind. The starter of scallop ceviche was nice enough, but I've had more flavourful versions elsewhere. The main of roast lamb shoulder was easily the best lamb I've ever had - crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. I couldn't eat it fast enough. Dessert of brown sugar tart with stem ginger ice cream was very tasty too, but seemed a bit tame in comparison to the passion fruit souffle - that had the most amazing, envy-inducing aroma.

Excellent food aside, everything else about The Ledbury is what you'd expect from a restaurant of this calibre. Staff appear from out of nowhere to top up your glass, and it's very tastefully (if a bit blandly) decorated. Save this place for a special trip with the foodie in your life."
Overall a very good experience. Our waiter looked after us really well and really understood what type of service we needed. We had the tasting menu which was very good although it did lack a wow factor. Would certainly recommend
"Beautiful menu, great staff, the wine recommendations were on point, food was delicious and delicate. They also gave me a second desert as I was celebrating my 30th. Would definitely go back for a nice evening treat"
"My favourite restaurant in London! Outstanding food, wine and service. Can't fault anything and having visited several times its standard has always remained high over the years. Great for a special occasion if you want a top experience."
"My wife and I had dinner here for my birthday (12-29) while we were in London during the holiday break.  From what I had heard I was expecting a great meal and service.  Ledbury didn't disappoint us.  We went with the tasting menu and wine pairing which was great.  The service was even better, each staff member was fully attentive to our dining experience.  This is how fine dining should be done!  People ask me what was our best meal and our the plates from Ledbury come are at the top.  A must if going to London!"
Amazing food! Every single dish was excellent in taste and presentation. Service is extremely friendly. Well deserved 2 michelin stars. Will definitely go back.
One of the best restaurants we've ever had the pleasure of eating at. The service was outstanding and the food was superlative. We tried the tasting menu paired with a half bottle of red and white. This restaurant is for special occasions but they do offer a la carte as well.
"Outstanding! What a night. ""Normal"" food, crafted to an insane level of quality and sophistication. But the way the staff analyse the situation and treat the individual customers so differently is second-to-none! Thank you!"
"Spent the afternoon here trying their tasting menu (6 hours in total). Service was great - professional and friendly. The restaurant manager was most accommodating when taking our order, re-adjusting the menu where required unlike some other restaurants of a similar level. The atmosphere was relaxed yet formal enough providing a high standard of service. The wine list is extensive with an Austrian selection of wines which I find rarely seen outside Austria. The dishes themselves are fantastic: both individual and combination of tastes and textures can be clearly distinguished giving some surprising combinations in tasting experience. Would definitely recommend the tasting menu which is seasonal."
"From the malted bread rolls to the passion fruit souffle, everything I tasted here was delicious and interesting. Some dishes were even difficult to guess what they were without asking the very friendly staff, who happily explain. My favorite was the lamb shoulder with baked Jerusalem artichokes (cooked/served in 2-3 different ways).
The decor is perhaps simplistic but fits with the staff that genuinely seemed happy to work there, giving the place a down to earth vibe.
Undoubtedly a great experience for your taste buds!"
"One of the finest dining experiences we have ever had. It has moved into our all time Top 3, which places it in exclusive international company. Incredible and inspired food, fantastic service, great wine."
"Fantastic experience dining at The Ledbury. The food was incredible (we had the tasting menu + wine), service was outstanding, cannot fault this restaurant. They even went the extra mile and served a special dessert for my brother for his birthday. Utterly exceptional."
Excellent restaurant! The tasting menu was amazing although I wouldn't go for the wine pairing. It was good but in my opinion not worth the price... (I'm not a wine expert tho...) The food was delicious and overall a great experience!
"Faultless. We enjoyed the tasting menu. Just maybe it was on the safe side, some dishes were more comfort and I'd expected something more exploratory, but wow, the execution was impeccable. One big plus of the Ledbury is the wine list, my wine was £400 while Umu sells it at £600. Corkage is £60, I took my own red, again service was perfect. One highlight is the chance to go downstairs and meet the chef. This is not to be missed, if he could bottle his passion for the menu he'd be even wealthier than me. Ha!  Thank you. Just great!  Now can I have chillies?"
"It all starts with the food- each plate a work of art that tastes as good as it looks. Put together with excellent service - friendly, while still meeting the highest standards- and you get a truly memorable experience. Recommended for special occasions."
"Outstanding food. Deserving of its prestige. As long as you're willing to pay, you'll get an unforgettable experience.

We had the tasting menu and everything was fantastic, particularly the Chantilly of Oyster and the Hen of the Woods."
"I have different impressions every single time when I'm there. Sometimes, the staff is not so polite, but on the other hand some employees are talkative and I enjoy our small talks. It depends. Anyway, I want to review the food - it is prepared carefully.
I appreciate the devotion of the professionals.
The atmosphere is good. So overall - The Ledbury is a nice restaurant, I recommend trying their special British meals."
"The Ledbury deserves its praise. While an evening here may cost you, it will still be worthwhile. Food quality is excellent, decor quite attractive, and service impeccable. The wine list is pretty extensive and includes some real gems albeit with the respective prices. The right place for a special evening. We love it."
I came here for my wives birthday and got the taster menu. This has to be one of the best meals i have ever had. Because it was her birthday we got a free course and were taken down to meet the chef and given a loaf of bread to take home!
"Visited the Ledbury yesterday on our anniversary. We had the most amazing time! Everything was perfect, the dishes were beautiful, they recommended us a wine that was sensational and the romantic ambiance was just what we were looking for. Thank you!"
"Friendly staffs, the connoisseur was particularly approachable and was clearly knowledgeable as he described the background of each wine. The combination of flavours and textures was brilliant, creative, and gastronomic. Truly a memorable evening."
This is one of the best restaurant in London. They offer delicious and excellent food and their chef have designed each course to be brilliant and completely different. Their wine collection is also excellent. So far so good!
"Our favourite restaurant in London. We try come twice a year and the staff (who remain constant) greet us with such warmth and familiarity. The food is simply wonderful. The oyster starter is my favourite dish (equally fresh and rich) but the freshly fried doughnuts are a complete treat! I see Google has this listed as a French restaurant. The chef is Australian and I would say that influences are international. Given the two Michelin stars, the atmosphere is relaxed and joyful."
"The best dining experience I have ever had. The food was incredible, great produce fabulously executed. The staff were fantastic. Impeccable service, i really can not fault anything."
"Oh, Ledbury, your divineness knows no bounds! What more can I possibly add to the previous reviews singing your praises? One reviewer perfectly described the food as 'rightness.' All the flavours are fresh and unique and it's just fun to eat- the mackerel is superb. Perhaps the only thing I can add to all the other reviews is to praise the service. One of the managers was also American and spent a good deal of time talking to us about the menu (he knew EVERYTHING!), the restaurant's and chef's backgrounds, and just about restaurants in general and comparing the American and British food scenes. He was really friendly without being overbearing and seemed to genuinely love his work and want to make it an enjoyable evening for us. The staff literally anticipated everything and knew what we wanted before we did, which made the whole experience totally relaxing and you never had to worry about something going awry. These are clearly professionals. If I won the lottery tomorrow, the first thing I would do is go eat at the Ledbury. Actually, even if I don't win the lottery I will go back and eat at the Ledbury- it's worth it."
"The most amazing lunch I've ever had. The service is phenomenal, the attention to detail is by far the best I have seen. Lunch menu is accessible and not too expensive. The dishes were amazing. Highly recommended !"
"We had a fantastic experience. The food and the service both amazing. Everything worked , and every dish was excellent, The waiters pamper you and you really couldn¨t ask for anymore. This restaurant is not like the others."
"Best dining experience in London. Brett Graham is a master of fine French cooking, but has developed his own style - no wheat, no dairy - and showcases incredible produce sourced each day from Scotland. What really makes the experience stand out is the service - every staff member was attentive and friendly, taking the time to get to know us and tailoring the menu to give us a wonderful and memorable experience."
"My second visit here, food was as great as usual. I like the service style which is causal and staff talks to you like friends. They offered free compost and we took one home to plant our herbs garden!"
"My experience of The Ledbury was rather mixed. Some of the food was fantastic but certain dishes felt like they didn't work - the frozen scallops stick out as something that was trying too hard and not achieving the desired aim. Having said that, the service was great and the atmosphere of the restaurant is one of sophisticated class. Despite my doubts around a couple of dishes, this is still a place that on the whole was a great experience and is somewhere I would return in the future."
"One of London's finest restaurants that lives up to the hype. The room feels classy and expensive, without being overdone or stuffy. The food is a great combination of classic and very modern. The lunch deal is very good value, but whenever you go will still cost you a large chunk of money."
"Brett, it's amazing what you and your staff have accomplished. The dinning experience was way beyond my wildest dreams. You are an artist of texture, colour and taste. Your creativity power is sublime. It was an honour meeting you! Thank you!"
"This is fine dining with an easy confidence and I am in the realm of heroic for taking my other half here for her 40th; she was in heaven.
It is, as with all good places, all about the details, the unforced ways they check your needs and give you much more. Even the feel of the extremely delicate stem to our wine glasses lingers as an impactful detail to the night.  A night to remember."
"Loved this place - everything was 10/10 - the staff, the service, the ambiance and last but definitely not least, the food...it was amazing. We had the 4 course dinner menu and it was fantastic. Thank you to you all at The Ledbury for making tonight a superb experience. We will be back!"
"Best fine dining experience I've had so far in London. Happy to know that its climbed up the ranks of top restaurants to dine in the world.

I would of given it 5 stars, however, unfortunately my husband found a hair in his dessert. They immediately rectified the mistake and apologised profusely and compensating us with a glass of cognac, however I was disappointed they told someone off in the kitchen loudly for the mistake which they could of done much more softly in a professional manner. Half of the diners heard that night which was my only negative comment - however, I loved all the dishes - wanted to lick everything on the plate."
"Spectacular.   So pleased to have the Ledbury back in action.  The food exceeded even high expectations, and the service was impeccable.  Already booked a return visit!"
Yummy well paced tasting menu lunch. Lovely wait staff and a friendly ambience.  The parking outside the restaurant was free!!!??? Unheard of in such a central location restaurant. It was a wonderful birthday lunch. Thanks so much to the Ledbury
"Great food and really nice staff. In fact, Jack, the restaurant manager is probably one of the best and most accommodating people I’ve ever met that really goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and enjoy your experience. Highly recommend!"
"If you consider food and preparing it to be a form of art, like me, here you'll feel like at an exhibition. The ingredients are carefully selected and combined into some of the finest dishes I could have imagined. The presentation, though is what makes this place stand out from the others. Exquisitely arranged, the dishes look like works of art, making you feel guilty for destroying them with the mere purpose of satiating your appetite. But then the explosion of tastes bathes your palate and there's no longer guilt, just pleasure. Superb!"
"This was hands down the best meal I had in England.  Surprisingly, it was less expensive than I anticipated too, and you get many little tastings.  Food was exquisitely delicious.  My friend and I got the lunch set.

The little canapes had a nice almost umami taste to them.  Canapes were the best part, imo.  Scallop was fresh and tender, and the venison was velvety, juicy and rich, except the meatballs which had a delightful chew to them.  Dessert was perfectly balanced between sweet and tart."
"Not one dish was actually good. They were pretty but all too buttery/fat/rich without any kind of the subtlety the chef used to have.
Shame"
"Pleasant British restaurant. You can enjoy some drinks or meals there. I think the atmosphere is welcoming. Besides, the price of each is quite normal and you won't spend your salary there.
Keep in mind that it would be better if you make a booking in advance."
"Amazing food with a clear vision. Didn't think it how the ""wow factor"" that other restaurants at this end do, and in some ways the menu felt safe, however everything was executed spectacularly. Service and wine list top notch too."
"The Ledbury is, in my opinion, the best restaurant in London. Incredible food beautifully presented, impeccable warm service and a lovely atmosphere. Have the tasting menu and book as soon as reservations open (at least 2 months in advance)."
"Once again convinced of stars and top ratings, but it not always lives up to your expectations when there are so many restaurants doing really outstanding food without this kind of hype (or awards). About organizing(except uncovered cheese table and everyone have to pass it when they are going to restroom), staff - everything was very professional."
"Best restaurant in London. Incredible food; the chefs led by Brett Graham have designed each course of the tasting menu (regular and vegetarian) to be outstanding and completely different from each other. The curd of buffalo milk with truffle toast is a favourite as is the passion fruit souffle with sauternes ice cream.
The wine pairings are chosen very well by a good sommelier who really knows each wine.
Relaxed atmosphere and great service from friendly staff.
I have been there twice for the tasting menu with wine pairings and plan to return soon. I believe this should get the third star in the near future; it'll be be well deserved!"
"Amazing service, amazing food.

Service was very attentive and explained the menu very well. There was no situation where we felt abandoned.

Food was very tasty. Presentation was great!
Money well spent."
"Three years ago I had one of the best meals of my life here.  Wonderful food, wine and service.  Modern contemporary decor.  A relaxed atmosphere."
"This is not just a restaurant; it is an excellent place to take to a gastronomic journey. There are details in this restaurant which make the place stick miles above the rest.
Excellent food, meticulously prepared, excellent service from very well dressed staff who are there to ensure you have a great time.
You have to try it at least once."
"My favourite restaurant. It’s a massive treat to come here (not least because of the price tag) and it is absolutely worth it. Of these types of places in London (fine dining, haute french cuisine) this is the standout. Staff make the experience not stuffy at all ( the opposite of le Gavroche!) which is disarming and really makes you feel comfortable while enjoying your meal instead of worrying about whether you’ve got an appropriate suit jacket on."
"Quite remarkable. Where else to have your wedding meal with mother and father in law(it was a very small affair)? A great meal is a mix of wonderful food and tastes, the people you’re with with and the place. The Ledbury had it all."
"This was my second visit to the Ledbury. The service is first class; all the staff pay attention to detail and go the extra mile to ensure everything is perfect. The food is sublime, beautifully presented and every mouthful is a culinary adventure. I look forward to my next visit."
"Worth every penny!
Went here for our anniversary in 2017 after nearly going with Alan Ducasse at the Dorchester. So glad that we chose the Ledbury!
From the moment we walked in we were greeted by smiles and friendliness. Our waiter was extremely professional, explaining every dish and even giving us tips about the food and the best way to eat them.
It’s shame that they might not open after the Coronavirus! Hopefully they do as it is a once in a lifetime experience."
"Okay so straight up I was pouting about going here - last time I stepped foot through these doors I was 10 years ago - i was midway through a bad relationship and all we focused on was espresso martinis ( they were incredible here btw ) and staying up until 5am...

a larger than life bill with dinner untouched and a half cut girlfriend meant that my experience here before was dreadful, almost as bad as my hangover the next day!

Now, a little older... maybe not wiser - as soon as we were seated... bang. My smile really did turn upside down. We dined as a four and sat near the corner - service was incredible, it’s like the waiter could hear my thoughts...! The wine was excellent and dinner slipped down easily... the bill was expensive, even for the area - but well worth it."
"Sadly the warm and friendly service isn't honoured by the food. The kitchen was late, and enjoyed things too smokey. While the sommelier was sincere the limited selection meant the pairings were harsh and obtuse

The head waiter was the only respite"
"Went here a couple years ago and found it somewhat overrated. The food is very good, and presentation is lovely. But it doesn’t set itself apart as a fine dining establishment, and the prices are out of touch with that reality."
I brought my wife here last week and our experience was really great. The Ledbury has great and tasty selection of foods that is worth every penny spent. Great! Your deserve to have a 5-star or  more!
"My husband and I went to the Ledbury for dinner to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary. We had a wonderful time. The food was delicious; a great mix of different ingredients, fantastic presentation and great taste."
"Absolutely spectacular meal; faultless food, wonderfully subtle service (no explaining of the food, quiet refilling of glasses, my favourite) and beautiful decor. I came for a set dinner with some work colleagues, and we were very impressed with the detail here, such as our delicious bacon and onion rolls, tiny and still warm, offered 3 times before the real food began (be careful, they're filling!).

A flame grilled mackerel, served up with celtic mustard and shiso was an absolute highlight for me, partly because I would never have picked it, and also because the fish had been cooked to almost resemble pulled pork; absolute melt in the mouth. Pudding was also some of the best I've had in recent memory; a warm passionfruit souffle with a spoon of cold ice cream dunked inside as it's served, and a burnt brown sugar tart.

Pricey but worth it - this place is as special as everyone says."
"As a 2 star place, relaxed friendly staff couldn't do enough for you. The starters were a nice surprise and delicious. The food and wine were all amazing. Overall, do yourself a favour and visit this place. Y"
"If you were to only have one meal out for a whole year - this would be the place to go.

Save up for the tasting menu with matching wines.

The service balances aloof with attentive - which we loved."
Fantastic food great ambience friendly staff got to meet the master chef Brett in the kitchen with a surprise fig leaf ice  cream to finish off our night. What a night to remember. Thank you. Will definitely be back when in the uk.
"Discrimination

I’ve been in London for 5 years and been to different high-end restaurants because my girlfriend is having a cookery course in London and we enjoy food. However, it’s my first time to actually go online and rate a restaurant.

The interesting thing is, some of the waiters thought we don’t speak English(well) and tried to make jokes on us. While they might think that’s funny, I thought that’s so stupid only because we are Asian. The first thing I learned in this country is about respect and be polite and I clearly and naturally use ‘please’ as much as I can and try to be polite in every aspects. It’s ridiculous in 2019, London, this kind of loser behaviour is still happening. I love this country and I’m currently working in a premier league football club as a football coach and my English level should be decent as a foreigner. I clearly understood what those waiters were mocking about and that made the thing worse.

For those who do not believe discrimination is happening in every corners in the world, one day it’s gonna come to you."
"We went here for my wife's birthday. From the moment we entered to when we left, we had a wonderful experience. The food was exquisite, the staff friendly and attentive. Fully justified as one of the premier restaurants in London."
One of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had in my lifetime…..
"Hidden in the midst of residential Notting Hill, the Ledbury is a lovely option for a quiet, but upmarket meal. I had the seabass with black quinoa which was a really great combination of textures. The pudding of passion-fruit souffle was perfectly done (of course) and was served with a scoop of ice-cream dunked into the middle - divine! The cheese course in comparison was slightly average but overall, an excellent meal. Props to the staff who were so discreet that they managed to top up my glass and put dishes in front of me without me even noticing! Worth the money for a very special treat."
"First three courses of the tasting menu were samey in texture. A bug crawled out of my husband's plate. Bones in fish. Apart from the sommelier, the overall service was patchy. Granted we went on a Saturday night but still. After the bug incident, they only removed the service charge from our bill. We were utterly disappointed and will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends."
"Easily one of my favourite restaurants in London for delicious food, attentive staff and general ambiance. I think it gets particularly interesting around Autumn when they showcase what they can do with game meats, or maybe I'm biased because we usually go in November to celebrate birthdays. The only thing that breaks my heart is the disappearance of the souffle from the menu. Perhaps it's a case of absence making the heart grow fonder when I wistfully think of the passionfruit souffle with sauterne ice cream."
Still one of the best meals we've had in the UK. It did help the sun shone and we sat on the terrace. The wine selection was one of the most memorable pairings we've ever had.
"Exquisite food and excellent service. You'll see effort in every detail at this place. I don't normally go after the stars since I've had underwhelming meals at so-called Michellin-stared restaurants, but I was really impressed by Ledbury."
"Everything is with 100% attention but still makes you feel comfortable, I would go again any day!  Staff is phenomenal, so and chat with you... Without feeling fake or rushed.  Plus the food is absolutely devine!"
"Rating this kind of place anywhere below excellent is just impossible, it may not be 100% in one's taste, but getting any better seems at least very difficult. I would highly recommend visiting this place for a nice and relaxing meal. Dishes are well balanced and have complex taste that develops while eating. Amazing!"
Must say one of the British pride situated in residential area of Notting Hill.  I tried the tasting menu and truly enjoyed all of it. Everything is refined and very well presented but not pretentious. Very well recommended although only two michelin stars and make an advance booking.
"One of the best dinners we've ever had: freshest seasonal ingredients, helpful and friendly service with a great sense of humour, really pleasant venue overl …"""
"What a amazing Experience
Less is more. The food was perfect in every aspect. Razor sharp ingredients, gently cooked. The Staff should have a star on their own.
Along with the Champagne Blanc de Noirs from Guillaume Sergent it matched perfectly well.
The Champagne was really intense and pure.
Pine, rhubarb wrapped in a subtile oak.
I recommend The Ledbury as well the champagne from GS
Well done impeccable."
"Warm and friendly staff, good atmosphere, food, drinks, great music. I’m regular at the Ledbury and what I like most is that there is no dress code and it still holds good reputation. I feel free to stop by for a coffee or lunch, or to take my girl to a drink or a dinner. The Ledbury sometimes invites talented musicians, who bring inspiration to everyone. Keep doing your job the way you do, guys!"
"I've been going here for years since I lived nearby when it opened in 2005. Admittedly much less often as the prices have risen inexorably. Still for a long time it's been my favourite - mainly for food but also an unusually winning combination of immaculate service with friendly enthusiasm.
Sadly, my most recent visit was hit and miss. Some exquisite dishes (notably the 'oyster chantilly') but some have gone wrong. The 'candied beetroot' which was amazing in the past, was flabby and tasteless. Smoked Hen of the Woods was great, full of flavour, but Scallop with Liquorice (apparently) was insipid and lacking conviction. The bread is still delicious with goat butter. The accompanying wines had been selected for interest (one from Tenerife, Georgia, East Austrian Pinot Noir, etc); some earned their place (notably the Fie Gris and Greek Vin Santo) but others did not or failed to complement the food.
Similarly, some staff still had the impressive knack of both personal warmth and discrete efficiency, others dropped things (several things) and were just too obviously a bit bored.
Overall, the place seems to be resting on its laurels, lacking invention. Maybe this was finally my last visit. Time to find a new favourite."
"Excellent food, excellent service and a really nice atmosphere. The food and wine was incredible"
"The service and food are faultless.
One of the most memorable meals I've had.
The only problem was deciding which dishes to choose as all sounded wonderful !
Must go back soon."
"I hate to be superfluous but this is the best restaurant in London. From the knowledge of the staff and somelier to the local and creative food, there is no place better to go for a special occasion.  The scallops from Orkney are so fresh, the seafood and meat cooked perfectly. To go and not order from the Tasting Menu is a sin! Impossible to pick just one main. So good. Unparalleled. Worth a visit to London."
An exceptional experience awaits you at this top end and very comfortable Restaurant. Try to keep to the lunch or dinner menus to keep costs down. Service is fantastic.
"One of the iconic restaurants in London. Everything on the menu tastes amazing and visually pleasing.

The presentation is not as good as Alan Ducasse at the Dorchester, but the food is at par."
"Out of any doubt one of the best restaurants in London for an overall experience.
Hidden on the heart of Notting Hill this restaurant fusion the classic attention to detail with one of the most exciting menus in the city.
The best place for a big celebration."
"Flawless service which was very friendly and welcoming. The food was tasty, creative and well balanced in flavour. The lunch set menu was super value too for £60!"
Absolutely fantastic! Faultless service who were very attentive without being overbearing. Sunday dinner we had the 6 course tasting menu. Superb!
One of my favourite restaurant in London. Impeccable service and great food. Prices reflect the quality so value for money is good. Great experience. I highly recommend it
"Exquisite food and the most impeccably paired wine flight I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Service was excellent and informative, and it was overall one of the most enjoyable evenings of my life"
"One of the top restaurants in London, yet only two michelin stars.  They have the finesse of a three star restaurant, and should get it as well.  Not too hard to get to, though you should make sure to make a reservation first.  Get the passionfruit souffle.  Just trust me and get the souffle."
"To preface my review, this is concerning a dinner I had at the Ledbury in April 2015 so it's somewhat possible that things may have improved. My partner and I booked a late dinner for two (9:45) and were looking forward to trying out a two star michelin restaurant. We have been to many higher end restautants in London and..."
"World class tasting menu with excellent service.
Try to meet chef graham and his team if you are lucky and got a table here. This restaurant deserves to be in the top 50 restaurants on the planet"
What a magnificent 8 courses of food. Each single dish more indulgent and wonderful than the last. The service will was without exception the best we've experienced. We will be back.
I went there two weeks ago after one year of being away from England. The atmosphere was formal but it was friendly as well. The staff had enough information to give correct advice and talk about allergens.
One of the best vegan tasting menu + wine pairing!! I couldn't recommend it more!!
Surely the best restaurant in London?   After many visits over more than 10 years it’s still as good as ever.  Outstanding service and wine list.
The Ledbury specializes in French and English cuisine. Enjoy the exotic appetizers such as amuse-bouche to extraordinary main course seafood recipes and the signature brown tart desserts. The Ledbury offers a great range of desserts and also widely popular for its specialties.
Each dish has its own touch of uniqueness which makes it a delightful experience. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Overall a very nice experience
"All of the staff are interested, friendly, enthusiastic about the food and wine and engaged. Brett, the chef, is welcoming and has no starry chef pretensions. His food never fails to hit the gold; even when you read a description and think, ""hmm, that doesn't sound quite right"". He has the confidence to retire dishes that all the regulars love and want to eat forever, but always comes up with wonderful new creations.

Seamus, the sommelier is the king of customer relationships, as well as being one of the best sommeliers around."
"Amazing food at the Ledbury. We went for the lunch menu, a four course meal which came with multiple amuse-bouche, a pre-desert, and petit fours, paired with delicious wines. Great food, great service, and an overall memorable experience."
The services here were great. The staffs are friendly and accomodating. The atmosphere was fine. The dishes themselves are fantastic. I would highly recommend this place.
"Given its reputation, The Ledbury is relaxed and unpretentious. The food is oustanding and the wine not as expensive as you might think. The service too is brilliant and friendly. Expensive but worth it."
"The Ledbury displays a unique talent for delicacy in food. Very attentive staff in a restaurant that is mostly occupied by international visitors. The venue is a bit off the beaten track, away from London\'s center, but it is definitively worth a visit."
Amazing food. Delicious and delightful. Just a wee bit formal which is not totally my cup of tea but sometimes that is ok to enjoy some exceptional food.
Best meal I've had in London. Every course of a very high standard with service being excellent. Can see why this is consistently ranked as one of the best restaurants in the world.
Wonderful experience at the Ledbury for a very special birthday. The food was incredible and the service faultless. Special really is the word to describe our experience - thank you!
"Stunning fine dining, an amazing experience. Australia visitors - especially from Newcastle - book ahead and hang the cost of the evening, this is an incredible restaurant with a local boy at the helm."
One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I highly recommend the tasting menu. You will need to book well in advance.
"Wow, the best meal I've ever had. Made feel very welcome and at home in the Ledbury. The front of house team are as good as the food."
"Excellent food, so was the service. Only down side is that we went for the hottest day of the year and that is one of the few restaurants of that standards in town with no AC!"
I was here two weeks ago and I really enjoyed the time spent here. Nice atmosphere and perfectly cooked food … I had salmon with vegetables and all was just great and the dessert I ordered was the icing on the cake.
"Really amazing food, have been here for the second time now and just cant say anything else! Service and atmosphere also A++ - definitely worth a visit!"
Outstanding customer service. The food and their interiors are of very high standard. The lobster tail was one of my favourites. Extremely good food and service.
"I am a taxi driver that picks up people regularly from this restaurant, I have not been in myself, but maps thinks I have so what I can say is this; everybody talks about how fantastic it was and how glad they were that they went, so by that measure, it must be worth 5 stars."
"As usual, superb food with excellent and attentive waiters and waitresses. Considering its level amongst such nearby competetion, the prices were pretty reasonable."
"Absolutely incredible food (skilful, beautifully presented and packed with flavour), wonderful service - a magical evening. Yes, it's expensive, but it's a 2* restaurant in London..."
The food is divine! Great matching wines. Friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Fantastic experience.
Went here for lunch on my birthday. Amazing service and food! Also got to visit the kitchen and was offered a sample of their sorbet which was great! Thank you
"Excellent Fine Dining restaurant. Absolutely loved the service and quality of food, the presentation and the wine ofcourse. Would recommend to anyone."
"Perhaps the best restaurant I've ever been to. Food, service, atmosphere all outstanding.  In particular the suckling pig was great, as was the mackerel."
"One of the best meals you can have.  Amazing food, fantastic wines, brilliant staff. An all round winning experience."
"Stunning food in a formal setting, that never disappoints.  It is pricey, but Michelin-starred restaurants have to make a living too.  For special occasions and special friends."
"Impeccable food, presentation and service. Vegetarian tasting menu was divine and they even took the time and effort to surprise us with extra birthday treats!!"
OMG  The cuisine is to die for! we had 6 entrees and shared... such a great dinner!! Il be back!! its like an art gAllery on a plate!! that tastes GREAT
"On the pricy side, also a waiting list to book here, but absolutely worth it. I also own their cookbooks, but more like coffee table books. A lot of time and effort goes in to these recipes."
"What an unforgettable experience! Amazing food, nice atmosphere, impeccable service! You pay for what you get though (very pricey). The best in London so far"
Beautiful flavours and textures with attentive and friendly service. This is the place to go eat in London at the moment. Absolutely amazing.
"This was our third visit to the restaurant and our shared opinion was that it was resting on its laurels. Service was perfunctory, food was unimaginative and experience was now overpriced. So sad."
"They have amazing food, probably the best in London. Although its a bit costly, but totally worth it. Couldnt have been better."
"Ate here around a year ago. They were better than Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. Truly, a perfect experience."
"Very good, but does not live up to its hype of being potentially the best restaurant in London. Still excellent obviously, but I'm giving it 4 for under performing expectations."
"The Ledbury is expensive, with food that is close to perfection, staff that are intelligent and highly experienced. It’s a class act. You go here when you want to impress and it never lets me down."
"Absolutely beautiful, food was spectacular and the staff were so accommodating to not only my sons dietary needs but my family in general."
"Lovely restaurant, great atmosphere, amazing staff and very assertive. Food came quick and was delicious, would definitely go back !"
Fabulous in every way! Service is not stuffy and over formal but friendly and welcoming. Food is sublime. Well worth the money
"Went there last night with our son and daughter in law and we all really loved it
The staff were superb and so helpful and the food was divine
Definitely worth a return visit"
"Delicious food, excellent service, great ambience! 5 stars!

Will definitely come back. It was a wonderful birthday, thank you!"
"If you can afford to eat here, you should do so - fabulous food and good service. Great atmosphere - don't miss the desserts."
Unforgettable experience. A place to go for a special date. Food is fantastic and service is impeccable. The truffle toast and custard is a must try
"Wonderful dining experience, we had a tasting menu for dinner, the food was superb, excellent service, highly recommended."
"Delicious and beautiful tasting menu with fantastic flawless service....couldn’t ask for more. Absolutely blown away, highly recommend!"
"Probably one of the best restaurants I ever been to.
The food is a work of art and the service is spot on.
Highly recommended."
Wonderful restaurant and experience. Their attention to details and dedication to the guest is beyond expectations. Fantastic!!!
Amazing! We tried the dégustation menu! A lot of delicious plates and an attentive service! Great experience
"Simply amazing, wife & I visited during our holiday we ate the Beef Short Rib & Filet & it's possibly the best steaks I've ever had"
Very unreasonable to come 15 minutes early in the middle of winter rains and ask customers to find a place where they don't have to wait in front of the restaurant
Was not disappointed with our second visit after so many years.
Excellent food..Very friendly staff. Here they explain every dish in detail . Very happy will visit again!!
"Absolutely superb! Food, wine and especially the staff! All made it an amazing night."
"Oh what can I say…
It's must be the best restaurant I've ever eaten before!!! And the best restaurant in London as well💪🏻
Don't forget to come to this fabulous restaurant or you will be regretted that you miss out the best restaurant of London."
"Truly at a loss for words here... and this coming from someone very opinionated who practically doesn't stop talking...

Love love love the food, top notch staff, decor...everything deserves 100 on the scale of 1 to 10 !!

Well, at least I tried..."
"Had an exquisite time here, really incredible food with fantastic service in a lovely atmosphere. Would highly recommend to everyone"
"Great food, faultless
Amazing front of house too, best i've ever experienced.  Attentive but unpressured and accomdating.  Will be back in a hurry!"
One of the best restaurants in London. The summer tasting menu is fresh. Definitely will go again
russia is flooding our cities and preventing our people from evacuating by launching new missiles into them
Had a lovely birthday here with my wife. They went out of their way to accommodate when my wife couldn't eat fish. Love this place.
"Love it, love it, love it. A repeat visitor, you get what you pay for. Lovingly crafted, imaginative and sumptuous food."
The level of service is great but the food we felt we felt was only average given what they charge for a four course dinner.
"We Loved The Ledbury. It's a high end  restaurant with excellent food, drinks and service. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated"
Spectacular!! One of the best meals we have ever had.  Impeccable service too!
"I can say that this is the best restaurant in London!!!!
Its an unforgettable experience!!! Hope they keep it like this for many many years!!!"
Hands-down the best food and service I've ever had in London. Literally can't recommend here enough.
"""This was our second visit, service was above and beyond what we would normally expect.. Food was amazing. Cannot fault it and will be returning again soon."
"Probably the best meal I had in my life, will definitely be back. A bit too busy but you will not regret coming here."
"One of finest meals I have ever had,highly recommend the tasting menu."
"This was a singularly lovely experience, and I loved every moment. The service really made everything shine, and we had such joy at each course."
"your post is not visible for long time on google so kindly get me some data of your restaurant i am only charging 1000 pound and for this you had to pay me first 500 pond in advance i am able to grt you listing on google...
for long time"
"If you want to sample truly haute cuisine, look no further. But have a chat with your bank manager first since the prices are eye-watering"
"friendly, easy-going staff, a relaxed atmosphere, and AMAZING food. seriously some of, if not THE, best food i've ever eaten"
"Utterly stunning food, service and wine. Attended for lunch and could not recommend more highly."
"Great dinner at ""The Ledbury"" ! Service and food was amazing. Hoping to come back soon. Thanks Javier Santos"
Superb service and food in a great location. High end but worth it for a special occasion or a dull grey Saturday in January!
"A special place I will never forget. Excellent service. Book now, the wait will be worth it! I highly recommend!"
I love the food and the atmosphere was really comfortable. Amazing place to grab your dinner
Excellent food and the fresh bread was superb (bacon and onion). Immaculate presentation and fantastic service.
My husband and I went there during our stay in Chichester during Goodwood Revival. The food was great!
"My favourite Michelin starred restaurant in London, the best food and a somewhat casual atmosphere unlike some other similar quality of restaurant."
"Just... just... amazing. Beautiful, accessible food. Not too formal, but definitely classy. If you can go, do."
"One of the best restaurants in London. Elite level of service, elite food. Excellent experience ."
"Amazing food and good service. Overall a great experience, would surely recommend this place."
Each dish is unique Very friendly staff  Overall a very nice experience.
"In a country where everyone seems to be doing his best to cut corners on quality for the sake of a quick buck, New York Best do their best to offer a quality product with attitude. Keep it up!"
One of the best restaurants in London. Faultless in every sense of the word. Can't wait to go back.
"Excellent food and brilliant service. Couldn't fault it, but I must say it hasn't ""blown me out of the water""!"
Excellent food and service.  Ate here a few weeks ago and can't wait to return again.
Delicious cuisine with a special touch that surrounds the exquisite. Extraordinary environment.Just delicious.
"Chef Brett Graham's innovative cooking, paired with fine wines in a smart, modern setting."
"Some pretty nice food, but for the price you can get better.
I reccomend sushi samba in heron tower on the 48th floor"
"That's simply the BEST restaurant in London!
From food to service to wine everything was simply perfect!"
I visited here on business a few months back. Accompanied with my local business friends we had a sublime evening. Thank you Ledbury.
Service is great. Food is great. Ambiance is great. Best restaurant I have ever been.
"The service was excellent, the restaurant is beautiful and the table setting is superb."
"Amazing restaurant, also great for vegetarians. Not pretentious at all which is rare for a 2* restaurant"
"Very nice atmosphere. Good food at affordable prices
Clean  friendly staff"
"Beautiful food, gorgeous inside and out!   Definitely worth a booking!"
Lovely food and people best time ever had first time there and England I will be back 100%
"The service, the food, the wine, all perfect!!! Maybe enjoyed lunch there more than dinner??"

Nice place. Enjoy going there with friends now and then.
Amazing. I would go there again and again if I could afford to (I cannot..)
"This is, hands down, the best culinary experience I've ever had. The service, knowledge of staff, and ambiance were impressive. The tasting menu was out of this world."
"Unpretentious, friendly and unique - in Arzak we embarked on a journey to rediscover familiar flavors and textures.

Meticulously prepared courses, beautifully presented without being loud or pompous and skillfully paired with the right wines.

The menu was well thought and designed to bring you on a journey to discover sea and land, with references to the traditional local cuisine.

The legacy can be felt as well as the evolution that Arzaks have persistently worked for over the years, elevating consistently what once used to be traditional.

The highlights were many. Lamb and seaweed in one of the courses brought the mere essence of Basque Country on a plate telling a story that combines masterfully the mountain and the sea.

The service was impeccable, the staff humble, professional and vivid contributed to the positive experience.

If Arzak is not the reason to visit the area, it definitely deserves your attention. Highly recommended."
"A very special place, for a special experience of a 3 star restaurant! The food is very delicious and nicely presented. The service was excellent, very warm and friendly, but not too much. The wines were very special!"
"Disappointed! All the dishes were below average, be it the technique, plating (pls check out the photos taken), use of tableware and taste is worst than many 1-star restaurants. We were so upset after spending almost 600€ for such an overrated restaurant. Service was good but it’s not justified for what it claimed."
This was the best we've ever had!  Everything is inventive and super yummy.  The new Sommelier is awesome as is the all the staff. We went without the pairing and ordered wine separately.  This way we were able to try even more delights.
A ⭐️⭐️⭐️ experience! Our expectations were high but they were met in all aspects.  The food wine pairings were perfect! I very much loved the sweet txakoli wine with the apple dessert.  This place was well worth making a reservation 3 months in advance!
"This place is just an institution. The first impression left us a bit unsure due to quite large amount of tables and quite a busy atmosphere but after the first bite the only thing we were thinking was that we’re fortunate to have a chance to enjoy the masterpieces coming out of the kitchen. Every single dish was just balanced to the point of pure serenity. They have a large arsenal of dishes to substitute if something isn’t exactly to your liking but our warmest suggestion is to explain your wishes and then fully trust the team.

Service and wine: Everyone was attentive and kind, we were guided through the menu with precision and the wine suggestion was on point with our flavour profile description.

Atmosphere: Fine dining institution which was packed to the last seat during our visit. It can happen you have a slight waiting time going to the restrooms because of that :)

While photos don’t do it justice, adding a few nevertheless."
"There is quite simply nothing that compares to Arzak. We have been blessed to experience multiple Michelin Three Star restaurants and all are wonderful culinary symphonies. What elevates Arzak is the art of hospitality. There is no pretentiousness, no judgment of the guest. If there is something you don’t prefer on the tasting menu, the service team effortlessly comes up with a different plan and verifies that it will work for you.

Chef Elena makes multiple passes through the dining room, meaningfully engaging with her guests and even referencing previous talking points. I have never witnessed this behavior at an establishment of this caliber.

The team has passion for their craft, loves their guests and are led with inspiration. Guess what. You taste it in the food…it has soul.

Cesar served us years ago when a relative of a colleague booked a reservation, and we had done no research to know what we were getting into. When we told him we couldn’t handle a full tasting menu, he crafted something that gave us the essence of the Arzak experience and it was exquisite. Cesar arranged a tour of the kitchen and even took a photo with me. I never forgot Cesar’s hospitality.

Imagine my surprise last week when Cesar began reviewing the tasting menu with the table next to us! The night ended with a long conversation about how Cesar had found his way to Arzak and the special brand of hospitality that can be found there.

If you have to choose one meal, this is it."
This was a magical experience from start to finish. My wife and I had the tasting menu.  The people and service were fantastic and the food was phenomenal. We also had the privilege of meeting Elena and Juan Mari to top it all off.
I had the pleasure and luck to get to dine here on my birthday! Our flights got Delayed and they worked with us!
The food is as great as advertised. Every course exceeded our expectations. Great service and very friendly. Elena even visited our table twice. I didn’t know that I needed fried garlic soup or corn ice cream in my life until today. Ignore the negative reviews and trust the experts at Michelin
"Phenomenal meal. Incredible attention to detail in the delicate and natural flavors involved with each dish. We especially enjoyed the relaxed, friendly, and attentive atmosphere the staff created. Hope to return again one day."
"The dishes were exquisitely prepared, but nothing was wow. Innovation was lacking in this place. Doesn't stand to its stars.
Half the food by size and quantity was desserts; otherwise, we would still be hungry after the tasting menu.

The staff were racist, both Elena and Adolfo. They approached our table with the first question of where we were from. We replied in Spanish that we lived here, but they insisted on repeating the question of where we were originally from.

Nothing to come back for."
"Underwhelming and overpriced
We had booked this restaurant months in advance for a special birthday celebration and were very excited to try it out. After having a fabulous molecular gastronomic experience a few month previous, the bar was set quite high, but 2 extra Michelin stars has to count for something right? To say we were left disappointed is an understatement. Upon arrival there was zero atmosphere in the restaurant, no music playing and the staff were cold and clinical. Yes, the head chef did come and speak to the table but it felt like just a formality rather than anything else. Throughout the meal, the chairs were not pushed in or out for guests as they went to the bathroom. Needless to say we were surprised to discover that there was little to no ‘molecular gastronomy’ served to us as the website so clearly states this to be a main feature of the restaurant. The food was average with no stand out dishes and they also mixed up the delivery of one of the courses - not acceptable at this level. During tea/coffee one of the table ordered a hot chocolate, to which returned a cup of thick melted chocolate, I’m confident to say that most people would understand hot chocolate to mean drinking chocolate given the context of the situation. And if you don’t, then confirm with the guest. It seems that the Michelin guide have been dazzled by the idea of a third generation restaurant holding onto their much acclaimed awards rather than reflecting the level of experience and food provided to the guests. Our experience did not reflect what’s expected from a 3 Michelin star restaurant in one of the top hot spots for food in Europe. For the reputation and the price our expectations were simply not met. Overall we were left disappointed and feeling a bit ripped off."
"I had never been to Arzak before, but dining here gave me the sense of being amongst old friends. Elena is an angel. Juan is the pope. Muy muy rico.."
"Hmm. This is a tough review to write. If I could give a 4.5 I would, but we’ll round up here. The food was very good, there is no question about that. Especially how perfectly everything was cooked. But there was not a single dish the blew me away, and I would have expected that for the price they charge never mind the *** Michelin stars this restaurant has received. The presentation was absolutely beautiful though, my pictures don’t really do it justice.

It’s probably €75 to €100 too expensive compared to other fantastic meals we have had this trip.

I would still have a hard time recommending to a friend for the food and price."
Culinary at its finest from the most fantastic chefs and people ! We are delighted and lucky that we were able to visit this legendary restaurant back in 2015! As soon as we walked in the warmth and the friendly unscripted attitude of the staff made us feel welcome. The flavors and execution unparalleled and mesmerizing . A dinner to remember forever !
"Excellent meal; the food was delicious and very cool/inventive, fantastic presentation. The service was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself could use an update; the setup is a bit strange and the decor a bit dated, but it’s fine. A wonderful experience overall."
"Carve out 3+ hours for your lunch. It is a  Michelin three star dining experience. There is only a tasting menu, which is excellent. Some of the highlights, after service, which was fantastic; a brined tartare fish (mackerel) w Jerusalem artichokes , the pigeon, along with monk fish, and the hors d' oeuvres, were thoughtful and a blend of simplicity and complexity. The staff is kind enough to give you a quick directive on each dish, Deserts were light, and true art, but we are partial to salt. You will need a reservation, and know there is only tasting menu, which with out wine pairing is 240€, I believe the wine pairing was 430€, took us a bit by surprise for lunch. They are a fair amount of casually dressed tourists, no stress on attire."
"If I could give 6 stars I would! Arzak was the most incredible fine dining experience of my life so far. The food was of course exceptional with the pigeon being a highlight: it was outstanding. What elevated Arzak was the homely, friendly feel: it was a joyous evening in which I not only enjoyed the food, but smiled throughout because of the friendly and good humoured service. We had the tasting menu, but this was tailored to ensure we both had individual experiences; albeit shared. Without question one of the highlights of my gastronomic journey so far. Thank you!"
"Great food and attentive service. Elena, the head chef, came out to say hello to us, which was a nice touch. Lovely experience overall, might be lacking a wow factor for a 3 star Michelin experience."
"Embarking on Arzak's degustation menu, I discovered a culinary journey that exceeded expectations. The meticulously crafted dishes showcased a perfect balance of flavors, each bite revealing a nuanced complexity that highlighted the chef's expertise.

Arzak's commitment to a well-rounded taste was evident in the deliberate pairing of ingredients, creating a gastronomic experience that went beyond the ordinary. The restaurant's sophisticated yet inviting ambiance added to the overall appeal, providing a backdrop that complemented the culinary excellence.

As the degustation menu unfolded, the seamless transition between courses and the unveiling of new flavors kept me engaged and excited. It was more than just a meal; it was a culinary exploration, leaving an indelible mark on my gastronomic memory.

In retrospect, Arzak delivered an amazing experience. The restaurant's dedication to exceptional flavors, combined with a welcoming atmosphere, truly earned its Michelin stars. My visit was a memorable journey through taste, and Arzak remains a standout in the world of fine dining."
"Better late than never, I celebrated my birthday on Oct 29, 2021 during the peak of Covid-19 at this fine establishment. Arzak is a true culinary masterpiece, a gastronomic journey that goes beyond borders and pleases the senses. Located in the heart of San Sebastián, this restaurant run by the talented Chef Elena Arzak and awarded three Michelin stars will take you on a journey through the art of Basque cuisine. The excellent service and perfectly matched wine enhance
the dining experience. My birthday celebration at Arzak was the highlight of this unforgettable journey."
"This is as good as it gets. I am so happy to have dined here and look forward to the next opportunity, should I be so lucky. If you are fortunate enough to do so, just sit back and let these professionals take you on an incredible journey in Basque cuisine."
Had such a wonderful experience at Arzak for our anniversary. Also had the pleasure of meeting chef Elena in person. She’s so lovely and warm. Service crew was impeccable. Food was top notch. Well deserving 3 Michelin star.
"Tasting menu, amazing food and good service. English is still a bit of a challenge and that takes away something from the experience if one does not talk Spanish. Great respect for produce: little done to let them shine. Loved the amuse with chicken, the avocado ice cream was something out of this world and the duck was absolutely perfectly cooked. The marbled egg something to try again. Good wines as well to complement the dinner."
"Went with my 3year old as his first Michelin experience and he loved it! They made a home made tomato pasta for starters, steak and chips for mains with homemade ketchup - all cooked up just for him! The tasting menu for the adults was an amazing experience too but the best dishes were the marbled egg, prawn and the pigeon was so soft and juicy! Chef Elena came out to say hi to us personally and to hear about her experience as a mother with 2 daughters was amazing."
"Got the tasting menu - amazing service, decent food.  The lobster was great, loved the prawn, and pigeon was cooked very well. Not sure if it’s mind blowing for a 3 Michelin star though"
"I first went to arzak 6 years ago and I always regarded it as the best meal of my life, and I've been very lucky to have visited quite a few other 2&3 star restaurants since then. However, I felt the meal today was a little disappointing. On the plus side the staff were incredibly attentive, friendly, and very accommodating with my wife unable to attend at the last minute. On the negative side the plates just felt a little flat and bar the egg dish none of them felt really memorable. The biggest issue for me was the tempo, tasting menu including coffee done in a little over an hour which just felt very rushed."
"Customer service was exceptionally bad! The waiter threw the menu on the table. And when asked what wine he’ll recommend for the dishes, he dismissively said whatever I want. What’s the point of a wine connoisseur. The worst Michelin service of all time! How did this kind of waiter/service even make it to the Michelin list? Total disappointment."
"Arzak, an iconic restaurant nestled in San Sebastián, holds a special place in the Basque culture, and our experience truly emphasized its significance.

Upon stepping foot into Arzak, we embarked on a culinary journey like no other. Opting for the tasting menu, we were treated to a remarkable display of creativity and artistry. Each dish showcased the restaurant's renowned originality, expertly crafted with meticulous attention to detail. It is no wonder that Arzak has become a revered gastronomic destination, attracting visitors from all corners of the globe who eagerly indulge in the seasonal seven-course tasting menu, available both at lunch and dinner.

Amidst the fervor surrounding Arzak's innovative approach, it remains deeply rooted in the culinary traditions of the Basque country. This captivating region, spanning both France and Spain, boasts a rich gastronomic heritage, and Arzak pays homage to its roots. It is worth noting that Basque country has long fostered talented female chefs, and Arzak stands as a testament to their remarkable contributions.

One cannot overlook the key to Arzak's resounding success—their unwavering ability to continually conceive astounding dishes. Both Elena, the present chef, and her father pour their hearts and minds into the pursuit of culinary excellence, ceaselessly pushing boundaries and embracing the new and unique.

Our overall experience at Arzak was nothing short of extraordinary. We relished every moment, savoring the symphony of flavors that danced on our palates. It was a testament to the dedication and passion that Chef Arzak and his team infuse into each and every dish. Arzak truly embodies the essence of Basque cuisine, leaving an indelible mark on the culinary landscape.

Indulge in an unforgettable dining adventure at Arzak, where tradition meets innovation, and the legacy of Chef Arzak continues to shine brightly, captivating hearts and palates alike."
"Three Michelin stars in tastes to be served with the hospitality and energy of Chef Elena.
A recommended and special experience."
"What a place, what a team of chefs, what an explosion of flavours!!! Definitely a destination,l for foodies...We had the chef’s table in the kitchen, had the ever seasonal tasting menu and chatted to founding chef Juan Mari and his daughter Elena...The cuisine is inventive yet authentic, delicate and yet wholesome... It hits all the taste buds. Nothing contrived and totally delicious..."
"This was a lovely experience. Regardless of the Micheline stars and history, it was a very relaxing and casual dinner. Three of us had the tasting menu without the wine paring and it was fine to consult on wine with the sommelier on two good bottles of basque Txakoli wine to start and an excellent bottle of red to end. The presentation was simple and lovely and the favors were astoundingly good. We opted for different options each for the mains and shared them with great results if you are up for that. The price is also stunning: $954 for three people with 2 bottles of wine. But still, this was a pilgrimage for us and part of the whole reason to be in San Sebastian in the first place."
Hasn’t disappointed on any visit. From the extreme quality and presentation of the food to the perfect wine suggestions and the most attentive service I’ve experienced.
"Great restaurant!!!!
Nothing is a coincidence.This restaurant has 3 michelin stars since 1989.I have not been to any star restaurant that is this flexible.If you don't like a dish they bring you something else.Friendly and so helpful.Everything was great.Congratulations!!!!!"
"We came here for dinner on our honeymoon with high expectations and frankly were quite disappointed. As many recent reviews suggested, food was good but not special enough for €210 per person. None of the dishes were really show stopping in terms of flavours and presentation - and when they tried to be dramatic with the presentation, it came off as tacky (think animated tablet under a dish and hieroglyphics that weren't done well). For the price we paid and for a three Michelin star restaurant, we expected an impeccable experience, and it simply wasn't. While the service was fine and efficient, it felt a bit hurried, like the staff was rushing around to serve every table. We did get two glasses of cava for our honeymoon and we got to meet Elena Arzak which was a nice touch, but sadly Arzak failed to wow us."
"Probably the best 3 starred Michelin star I’ve ever been to! This restaurant has had its 3 stars since 1989, that alone is an astonishing achievement! And not many restaurants can or have done that!

Elena Arzak, the brilliant daughter of Juan Mari Arzak, surprised us by coming to take our order berself(!!!)! She was absolutely fantastic, knowledgable and brought so much energy to the room before we even started eating. She was kind enough to allow for a cheeky picture and even sign our wine cork as a souvenir.

The food…was phenomenal and out of this world. Highly recommended, enjoy every bite if you’re lucky enough to go!"
"As you'd expect, superb food, great atmosphere and a relaxed environment. Tasting menu was well balanced but I was a little disappointed they didn't have a wine pairing. Well worth the visit if you're in town!"
Amazing place if you want to know why San Sebastian is one of the world's food capitals. Each dish was extremely well thought through and tasted great. Service was a bit harsh but this is Spain after all. Had some great wines and a truly tremendous time.
"Exceptional meal with professional, attentive, unobtrusive service. They were able to accommodate us at the last minute only due to a cancellation. If you want to eat here, reservations are required. In addition to the last minute availability, they put together a vegan tasting menu on the fly for Jacqueline. The care and appreciation for food quality and a delightful experience is obvious in everything."
"The food is good, no question about that but whether or not you find it worth the price is a personal thing.

I had meals that tasted equally excellent for 10% of these prices, of course the setting is more like plastic chairs and tables on a beach.

We had the bad luck that next to us, there was a table with very loud speaking customers, that ruined a great deal of our experience.
I would applaud it when the staff would ask such people to lower their voices"
"Come here before you die.

Of course, not only this is a ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Michelin, but it's been a 3-Michelin* restaurant for 30 years, so it's not going to let you down easily.

Nevertheless I need to say that we came from little experience in high-end restaurants. So we ordered the Tasting Menu. They guided and taught us.

As I don't want to write a long review, here are the highlights:

- The food was an unforgettable experience. A lot of different dishes, all of them tasty, all of them new, all of them art pieces. In case you're wondering; after eating we were full and joyous, so you will not leave the place hungry.

- Customer service was EXCELLENT. We had a male early 40sh attendant at our table. He was intelligent and friendly. Giving us different choices (some outside the menu so we could enjoy more dishes). Good talk and good jokes. He went the extra mile and we were able to meet the legendary Jose Maria Arzak!
The rest of staff was kind and professional too.

- The place was beautiful and not huge, only few tables in our floor, which it made us feel cozy and welcoming.

The well deserved damage came up to €503 for me and my wife including about 4 glasses of wine and 1 of cava.

Again, at least once in a lifetime

PS: San Sebastian/Donostia is gorgeous, so it will make the perfect trip!"
"What is there to say that hasn’t already been said? Just a life changing experience, the tasting menu is a must, and every single dish is so perfectly curated and executed. The staff is wonderful and the wine was excellent. I’m very fortunate that I’ve had the opportunity to eat quite well in my life, but this meal was something particularly special. If you’re in the Basque Country you have to take advantage of the opportunity to sample some of the Michelin starred restaurants, and Arzak should be at the top of your list."
"Heritage.
That's what you think when you choose Arzak Restaurant. Of course the story (history) is very important, but first of all the purpose of the visit is food and stile of cooking.
You will not find something here, and if you will visit some fine dining places in Bilbao and Basque Region your experience will be much better. Quality of cooking maybe the subject of discussion, but bones in duck meat is a failure.
The egg course (this time marble) is perfect, no starch (potato) opens new flavours of this popular in fine dinning course."
"Arzak should have been a lot better than it was - for a place ranked 21st in the world. The service was lovely, and it was amazing to meet Elena. However, the food was fairly unimaginative and the plating was just strange (and a little tacky). We had the 7 course tasting, and there was no knockout dish that really blew us away. At €220 for the food, and with a reputation like Arzak's, we expected a little better. Wine was affordable and quite good.

Overall, a bit of a disappointment - we had better food at a tenth of the price in San Sebastián itself!"
"Arzak was a great experience. The tasting menu showed chef Elena creativity and dedication to her craft of creating new, beautiful, and tasteful food. Our table was lucky enough to have had the opportunity to speak with Chef Elena. She was extremely friendly striking conversation and looking for any feedback on her dishes. I loved Arzak, great experience and great food. Would highly recommend the restaurant to others."
"A great experience as always! Not only love the food, but services is superb and they make you feel at home. Thank you
Pd I’m a vegetarian, so they created an as hoc menu that could be envied by the others 😉 …"
"I really enjoyed the food and flavours at Arzak, especially the way they've design their menu which allows a bit of flexibility which allows a couple to sample a variety of dishes from their menu.

The overall experience and theatrics doesn't compare to those of Heston at Fat Duck or of Daniel Humm from Eleven Madison Park, but the food and flavour is definitely on point.

Price wise  I think you can definitely get better value especially since you're in San Sebastian already and great food is almost located in every corner.

If you're not on a budget and open to different experience I would recommend it but like I said it doesn't compare to some of the other top restaurants from around the world."
"Fantastic experience with excellent food that was served in a very smooth and efficient manor with a professional and personal touch. All in all a perfectly executed lunch. Very nice also that Elena came to our table twice, much appreciated!"
"Why 3* is a mystery! I didnt paly, I was invited, my lover wanted to impress me, I was not impressed. In France I eat much better food for half or less the price. Overpriced, overdone without substance. 150 eur/ person is not a joke, it's a scam!"
"Fantastic experience. We had the tasting menu which was was very extravagant, detailed, beautifully presented and delicious! Chef Juan and Chef Elena individually came out to greet us and every other guest during our lunch which was a really lovely touch. We also asked the waiter if we could check out the Kitchen and he was more than happy to take us through! At the end of our lunch he brought us to the kitchen and gave us a 5 minute overview of the Kitchen operations. It was an awesome way to finish our lunch. We highly recommend Arzak!
Additionally, Arzak was completely booked out for dinner reservations one week in advance so we ended up making a reservation for Lunch which had the same tasting menu anyway.  So try book ahead."
Truly an exquisite experience to be remembered for the rest of my life.  Elena was extremely sweet and her kitchen was on pointe.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
"What a beautiful and amazing experience. As soon as you step inside, you are greeted by a slew of friendly staff members. They escort you to your table and you are immediately greeted by a member of the wait staff.

We started the meal with a glass of cava, and decided to do the tasting menu. It was not a mistake; the meal was elegant,  perfectly timed, and absolutely delicious! The house sommelier paired a white wine with our meal, and he never lacked in ensuring our glasses were consistently filled. While the meal was being served; the chef went and spoke to our table and those surrounding us. The marinated fish served on a cantaloupe was suprising and tasty! Each plate seemed to surpass the next. Ny personal favorite was the gingerbread with different sauces. However, what stuck me as absolutely perfect, was the desert.

The desert was a textural and flavor exploration; tangy meringue mixed with a sweet ice cream and dehydrated fruit. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal."
Great food and experience! Kitchen very very flexible. Satisfied client here!
"One of the best restaurants of the city and probably of the entire world. The exotic dishes and his unique culture makes this site one of the best must-go sites that you'll ever come across, despite its very elevated price."
"Great food. Top tip for those from the US (about >60% of your clientele, it appears) ... You may not want to brand all of your female servers with a scarlet letter “A”. It has a slightly different meaning to us who remember high school English class."
This was my #1 on the bucket list for any 3 Michelin Star.  Did not disappoint.  Elena wasn't in the kitchen but the Sous Chef carried well.  He was also friendly and allowed us to take a photo with him inside the kitchen.
"Honestly, I am not easily impressed. This is the experience of a lifetime!  If you can ever get a reservation at Arzak do not hesitate. Yes this restaurant was featured by the iconic Anthony Bourdain as his favorite city and restaurant in the world after we had visited twice, and I agree! San Sebastián is my favorite city and how lucky my favorite restaurant just happens to be there!  Arzak is amazing on another level and is run by the Top Female Chef in the world. It’s the most memorable dinner of my life. Thank you for the magical evening as we celebrated our 20th Anniversary❣️"
"We have eaten at Ametsa in London many times so when visiting San Sebastian, Arzak was a must. It did not disappoint. The experience was truly fabulous from start to finish. The sommelier was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was something else. If you are in the area and fancy a treat this is the place to go."
"Everything was great! Food was delicious, service was great, everyone is super nice, and it's lively. 5 stars all the way."
"We had an incredible time for dinner. Delicious food, reasonably priced wine and amazing service."
Incredible experience. The staff and Chef Elena are wonderful. Best tasting menu we ever had and it was worth the trip from the US. Each dish was very original with exquisite flavors and presentation. Sommelier was very nice and friendly and made great recommendations. Best wine ever. You will never regret this gastronomical experience.
"Small local but quality very good. Menu with a lot of Basque product, you can choose different type of dishes, from tapas to main. Suggested"
"First time in a Michelin 3 star restaurant and it was amazing! Tasting menu gives a good variety of flavours, friendly staff who are flexible with your preferences. Interior not my cup of tea but comfortable seating. By the way we are not very experienced wine drinkers but the sommelier advised us reasonable priced excellent wines."
"A joint birthday(40 & 50th) celebration, and a wonderful place to celebrate. Great staff, amazing food and not at all pretentious - meaning that you can relax and enjoy both the food and company.  Highly recommend the taster option."
"We had the most INCREDIBLE meal here! Well worth the money for such a high-end experience. What stood out the most was the attention to detail and the accommodation of members of our group who are sensitive to certain types of seafood. The wine pairings, mostly from Spain, were top-notch. Chef Elena came around TWICE to speak to all the tables, ensure we were having a positive experience, and learn about us. She has such a vibrant personality! Can’t wait to come back and will highly recommend to anyone in the area."
The service here is Amazing!! Worthy of 3 Michelin star
"It was everything I hoped it would be! The food without doubt was beyond amzing. The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. Overall just ""Awesome!"""
Delightful classic Michelin *** meal. Not cheap but you get what you pay for. Enjoyed the very flexible service - it's clear that the team is committed to the enjoyment of each guest over delivering the set menu they intended at the beginning of the day... I appreciate that they are very conscious and considerate about wanting to meet the guest where *they* are.
"Photos don’t do this wonderful restaurant any justice. Amazing wine selection and spot on service. The food is whimsical, thoughtful and fun without a hint of pretension. Loved it!"
"Great experience for all our family. Food, presentation was great. Small thing - one of the waitresses acted strange like we were aliens or little children. In some other Michelin star restaurants I saw more professional service. But I rated 5 stars anyway."
One of the best meals I've had in my life.
Delicious tasting menu accompanied with wide list of vines. Worth every star Elena and her father earned!
"Nice building. Although it is a fine dining restaurant, it gave me the feeling of a family restaurant. The staff were really nice."
"Excellent fine dining experience with a more casual feel to fine dining.
All the staff were excellent, helpful, knowledgable, fun and attentive to some of our dietary requirements. The food was outstanding and worth a visit if you are lucky enough to be in San Sebastián and get a reservation"
"Food that is quite amazing and high quality, a lovely restaurant and friendly serving staff. Highly recommended!"
"The wife and I travel to destinations with good food. Unfortunately we was very disappointed after a visit to Arzak

The way the food was arranged was nice, but also as you should expect from a 3 star restaurant.

The food itself didn't have a lot of surprises, which is what we often experience on Michelin restaurants. It was tender, but again nothing that deserves 3 stars

The room was small, filled with 8 tables, and 21 guests and the noice level too high. It was a busy serving, too many waiters just running around, sometimes just standing in the room look at us,, they should discretely be there, and not take up so much space

Used plates were place on a table just behind us, noice from the kitchen loud, not a nice setting

One of the dishes came while we were still eating the previous one, placed on a table and just waiting. Replaced so fast that I didn't get a chance to order a new glass of wine

Took wine by the glass, good at okay price, but not presented at all. The waiters actually appeared arrogant, and sometimes you felt they were talking about you

Again food, was okay, but nothing special, I would any day choose restaurants like AOC, Geranium in Denmark or Delta in Athens, which are far above the experience we got here,, a tourist trap where the fact you can say you have been there, is more important than the quality,, price 654 EUR incl 7 glass of wine"
Whether you have the tasting menu or “a la carté” you’ll find yourself surrounded by magical flavors and tasting experiences you’ll never forget. An experience not to forget.
"Treated my partner for her 40th birthday celebration. Wasn’t cheap, but I’d go again in a heartbeat. Lovely and amazing food but it’s more of an unforgettable experience more than anything. The staff were lovely.
A visit that I’ll never forget."
"Excellent tasting menu, loved the choices. The dishes were simply excellent. Must stop for foodies"
"My review will not carry the same weight as 3 Michillin stars, however tonight I had the greatest meal 9f my life. Everything was seamless and of the highest standard from when I walked in the door to when I left. It is an incredible place where the staff make such a special evening. Worth every €!!"
"Truly one of a kind. Toured the kitchen, wine cellar, laboratory, met Elana oh and had a menu sampler tasting that was out of this world."
"Super experience! we got the chef's table and it's incredible! very unusual atmosphere! delicious food, friendly staff, super sommelier and incredible chef Elena. Thanks to the whole team for a wonderful evening! Definitely recommend and we will repeat 😊"
"One of the pillars of Basque haute cuisine in San Sebastian, need to reserve early to secure a table. Chef Elena Arzak cooks refined and tasty dishes, and comes to greet customers in person. The deserts were fabulous. Excellent wine list and service. Unfortunately a little bit cramped since the restaurant is still in its historic location where it started more than a century ago."
As good as it gets. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and met Juan & Elena Arzak. What a treat!
"This restaurant's reputation precedes itself.
I came in with high expectations and yet they were exceeded.
Food, wine, service - everything was top notch.
We were even fortunate to have a good conversation with Elena!
Those that want to experience the zenith of fine dining, this is it."
Thoroughly enjoyed my time here. They’re great about letting you change up the tasting menu if you have something you’d love to try.
"this is my favorite three star restaurant. the food is amazing and with a 4 person party you could try one of every option. although, I think everyone who chose the hake instead of the shrimp regretted not getting the shrimp. this is the best cooked shrimp we've ever had. the head is perfectly cooked so you can get the sweetness from the shrimp ""butter"" and the rest of the shrimp is great as well. the hake is amazing too but you need to give up the shrimp to get it. we tried everything except the foie for the main red meat course and the restaurant's rankings of the options matched our table's rankings ( i.e. get the pigeon).

the service here is flawless and accommodating. we've been to 3 stars all over the world and this wait staff is the only one that balances genuine care with great execution.

they are also really kind to child diners here. they provide a la carte options for younger diners and included them in the amuse and after meal chocolate so they wouldn't feel left out."
"Phenomenal food, excellent service. If you're going to do any restaurant in San Sebastian make sure it's Arzak."
"I ate at Arzak for the first time in 1987 and have been back dozens of times since then. I have never been disappointed. The food is constant evolving, and always delicious. Do the tasting menu (you don't all have to have the same things!)"
Wonderful experience! We visit San Sebastian for two days and this restaurant was worth it. Fine dining with 10 stars
"Amazing Food experience but 10-12 menu courses was bit too much for us as we are small eater, Excellent quality Stars Restaurant.
She is a very nice friendly Lady and give us some tips where to go for excellent Pinxtos in Old City Center.

It would great if the Table setting not next to each other. We had 2 Russian Lady next to our Table and they were very Loud.

It needs space and tranquil Atmosphere. We didn’t feel romantic to celebrate our Love here.

It was difficult for us to enjoy the Experience being there and we paid a Fortune for this, flowing direct from Amsterdam to Bilbao then to San Sebastián by car.

Maybe we will try it again next time but also not sure."
I am sure there is too much written about Arzak definitely the place to eat at San Sebastian. Arzak team will make you ask for more and more...
"I want to start this review by saying I want to be very fair with regards to our experience here. The service was excellent and what you would expect from a Michelin 3-star restaurant. Unfortunately, the entire dining experience did not live up to the standard we had hoped to enjoy for the price that we paid (approx. $1000 for 2 people with wine pairing for dinner).

We have dined around the world at fine dining establishments from South Africa to France, all over the U.S., etc... We definitely had high hopes for Arzak, but were extremely disappointed.

The meal was good, but it was not excellent by any standards. The food seemed unimaginative compared even to some of the pintxos we enjoyed around San Sebastian. Flavors were dull, and the dishes simple -- for example, the lamb lacked any flavor that we couldn't recreate at home even better (we make meat dishes a lot).

And the wine pairing wasn't outstanding. I'm in the wine industry and have paired many dinners over 10 years, and this pairing was just not worth the approx. $150 pp you pay for it. You would be better off using that $300 to buy a couple great bottles of wine from the list. And the list is comprehensive. This was perhaps our mistake.

I enjoy doing pairings because I like to see the combinations the somms come up with. At our dinner, all the wines were poured from large format, which is fine, except that I could tell the bottles had been opened for a while. Stored correctly with regards to temperature, but the wine was declining -- just wasn't as fresh and vibrant as it should have been. For example, one dish was paired with a Manzanilla sherry, which I LOVE. But the bottle poured at our table just didn't express those rich flavors you expect from an excellent sherry. It was disappointing.

One of the desserts was paired with an Iscider Suecia, which is Swedish ice apple cider. The cider was paired with a dessert featuring Yuzu and cherry cream. Yuzu has citrus flavors. The cider is made from apples. The flavors were completely contrasting. Perhaps the dessert would be better paired with a late harvest or botrytized wine with more complementing flavors. Again, not the cider's fault, but when it comes to wine pairings at a 3-star restaurant, you would expect excellence in thoughtful pairings (not ice cider).

Bottom line was that the quality of the experience was good, but not what one may expect for 3-stars and that price tag. The service and the ambiance matched that of what we have experienced in other European Michelin restaurants.

Perhaps it was an off night, but I did want to give a fair review of our overall experience."
What can I say. This is one of the best restaurants in the world.
Amazing! Elena Arzak is masterful and genuine. Loved the food and the experience.
"Was amazing, staff were phenomenal and made my husband feel special for his birthday."
"Amazing service and food. This will cost you a lot but it is a very famous place and we were certainly looked after. They are very clear they cannot allow only one, of two, to do the wine pairing. I didn't fully understand the reasons but given they make less money if they don't allow this, I have to respect their service reasons and go with them. I still had an amazing evening and remember, this is a fair way outside the San Sebastian environs."
"They really do try to please, however the dishes were complicated to a fault. The food was designed toward presentation and academic taste, but unfortunately not delicious. The Langoustine was not sweet. The wine pours were very small. For a three star  Michelin this was a very disappointing experience. The chef was very personable and very concerned that we were not happy because we left a lot on our plates.. I wish them luck as they seem to take great pride in their restaurant."
"Fantastic meal and experience all around, the hype is well earned. Unlike other 3 star tasting menus, Arzak doesnt have 20 plus courses, it's manageable. Wine pairings were perfect, portions were small enough to not fill but large enough to enjoy more than one bite. Staff was great, Alena went out of her way to greet and chat with every time. Could not have been happier, best meal I've ever had"
"Very relaxed atmosphere, with an amazing culinary adventure leading the way.
Some of the best dishes I've ever had, and potentially the best meal as a whole.
Very friendly staff, and in the end Juan Mari came to say hello, which was the icing on the cake."
"Food is great but the service is not. Especially for a 3 star Michelin I expected more. Vegetarian food seems like an afterthought as well. Would not come back, especially considering the great amount of Michelin stars in this city"
"We had the most lovely experience! The food was absolutely delicious & the service impeccable. They were so accommodating with me not wanting seafood & that we chose to have 1 of us do the tasting & 1 of us to do a la cart. The servers were warm, kind, & offered suggestions to us. We so appreciated that while this is one of the best restaurants in the world, there was not an air of pretension. The dishes are beautiful & the taste is unparalleled. Chef Juan Mari even came by each table. This restaurant truly wants their customers to appreciate wonderful food & service. I can’t say the same thing about a particular other Michelin restaurant in the area."
What an experience deffo one off the bucket list 👍🤩👏👏👏
"Was good but would have expected better for a 3 star restaurant. Missed creativity, presentation and waiter didn’t describe the plates good “vegetables with sauce”. Nothing compared to other star- restaurants. Place missed of natural light. Not worth the price."
"Very decent tasting menu. Solid wine pairing. I really liked the chef, she came out to introduce herself and made us feel welcome."
Best restaurant I've ever been. No wonder it is one of the best restaurants in the world. Pricey but worth the experience. Lots of flavors that come together like a symphony. Extensive wine list very reasonably priced.
"Great food, just be prepared to spend several hours there. Overall, thoroughly recommend."
"The hype is real. We visited several Michelin, starred restaurants on our trip, and on many other trips. this was certainly the stand out. Absolutely worth the trip, and a must visit if you can."
"would not recommend this place at all
the food gave my whole family, all 8 of us, food poisoning. we all got extremely sick. we vomited and had diarrhoea non stop.
paid so much for the food just for us to get sick. told the restaurant about this but they were very mean and unempathetic and unapologetic.
super angry about this incident.
DO NOT go to this place."
"Who ever been to few Michelin star restaurant would realise this one is a joke! Been raised by foodie parents who took me very young to all french michelin stars. Then myself been travelling around the world to try them, Donostia is a pure marketing scam. Been in the all 3 stars restaurants who absolutely don’t deserve it. This one being probably the most undeserving. Firstly the portions. Way too big. How can they expect us to eat degustation menu when it is served in such big portion. Secondly the creativity is similar to a brasserie. Nothing interesting, nothing new, no special texture. Nothing! Just plain dishes, surely well executed and well cooked but that it worth even 1 star! Absolutely not! As for dessert they tried to create something in one dessert, which is if I recall chocolate, mint, mango, passion fruit and something else. Not that I don’t like the mix of taste on the contrary. But putting a chocolate cake with a mango sauce with a drizzle of mint and piece of passion fruit. In one go. Just like a kid would have dropped all the sauce in one dish does not make it as a michelin star dish. I can keep on but I honestly rarely write reviews as I don’t have time to waste unless the restaurant made me waste even more time. So 280€ or more for a 8 brasserie style dish is ridiculous. The only thing that worth the star was the irréprochable service but you don’t go in the restaurant for the service ! Avoid arzak and the other old 3 michelin. Focus on the 2 stars especially one of a girl name ( cannot mention) who s actually deserve his 2 stars"
"The meal was well prepared and presented. The servers, owners, hosts were very friendly and inviting. I enjoyed the experience, but felt they were lacking a wow factor.  Maybe not their best night. For 600+ € for 2  it should have a surprising  unexpected element. I respect their reputation and what an amazing city they have helped create, but I can’t say 5 stars. With that said, a very tasty meal."
"The food across the board is of an extremely high quality though for the price we were perhaps expecting a little bit more. Some dishes wow (the monkfish) but others (both the meat dishes) were a little one note.

Service is very good for the most part, however one of the staff was new and made a few errors, not the end of the world but the knowing looks and reprimanding she continued to get in front of us was the part that was a bit offputting. Additionally we were given 'complimentary' chocolates after dessert, it turns out we were charged for these which left a pretty sour taste given the cost of the meal.

Decor/atmosphere is a bit odd. It evokes a dimly lit conference room with no music.

It's especially appreciated that Elena makes the effort to come and speak to each individual table, making it even more memorable. Overall this was a very nice meal but not sure it's one I'd visit again."
"Very nice tasting menu - marbled egg, lobster and monk fish were my highlights. The house sparkling wine was also great and the brown bread here is the best bread I’ve ever had"
"Everything about the experience was top notch.  As you might expect from the history and the people involved.  We did the current tasting menu and of course some were better dishes than others.  But the overall experience, creativity, flavors, and delights made this one of those amazing meals.  It was also great to see regulars as well as food tourists like us enjoying the creations here in a welcoming environment.  Reservations are a must!"
"Fabulous in all ways.   Worthy of its Michelin rating.  Lovely venue, superior creative food, high quality service and extensive wine list (and excellent lower cost recommendations that worked perfectly with eclectic food choices at the table).  A great experience.  Expensive but fully justifiable."
"Excellent from start to finish. We were only able to get a lunch reservation but the menu was the same. First the waiters were fabulous. Personable, attentive & helpful. He talked us through the menu offering suggestions and his favourite dishes. Someone also suggested wine. Each dish was exceptional. All my partner & I could talk about was the food we were eating the entire time. Presentation was matched by taste, both innoventive & original.  was the first Michelin Star restaurant we visited in San Sebastian and it certainly set the bar. Inside was fresh & modern. Was worth every penny. We  were given a printed menu of our choices to take home at the end and our waiter even recommended the sister restaurant for us to visit in London - which we did! Highly recommend."
"At least to my taste, the food was not satisfying. I could see that the dishes were interesting and held uniqueness. However, the quality did not meet my expectations. Taste is a personal thing so I won't go further on that but I will add that I could see that not even the staff felt confident about their kitchen.

The real problem was the service and cleanness. The restaurant was understaffed with everyone haphazardly rushing around. I did not expect to have to pause eating to pour drinks for my table at such a prestigious restaurant. As for cleanness, the silverware and plates neglected detail. At one point, there was even dried sauce that was obviously from a previous usage on one of the ""fireplace displays"" that they placed on the table.

All in all, Elena, the owner of Arzak, was a wonderful person to meet but I hope she understands there can still be improvements to the restaurant. Compared to other Michelin-recommended experiences, this was not a pleasant one for me."
"The food was delightful but we suffered terrible food poisoning from the lunch. All 8 of us had the tasting menu & everyone either threw up or had diarrhea after that. It was so bad that my daughter nearly fainted and had to be hospitalized. It spoilt our entire holiday as we only recovered from the ordeal 3-4 later. Arzak refused to admit that it was their fault and was defensive and claimed that we were the only ones that suffered the food poisoning. We have been to so many Michelin star restaurants around the world and this is the first time we have ever suffered gastroenteritis from a Michelin starred  restaurant. Thanks to Arzak, San Sebastián will be remembered as our trauma trip. They definitely have to improve their food handling!!!"
"Food was good but nothing was mind blowing. The flavour profile seemed too engineered and it was not clear at all what the main attraction should be or how the flavour themes should fit. The desert was the highlight but they also gave different desserts to the man and woman on the table, while while cute, was a bit strange. Quality of service was also on par with that of a one star at best.

Overall, for the price, this is not worth it..."
"Came here for dinner during by honeymoon trip. First time to a Michelin 3 star restaurant and it definitely did not disappoint.

Had an amazing meal and the service was excellent. We really wanted to try their tasting menu but felt it would have been too much food for us. So instead of having us order a la carte dishes they let us order customized 4 course tasting menu instead.

Although I found one of my dish (monk fish) a little too salty, they took care of me by immediately replacing it with a different dish. Elena even came out herself to check to ensure everything was OK. It was. The replacement along with everything else was delicious.

Love this restaurant. Will return."

A truly memorable lunch. Treated to a first class experience by Elena and her team.
"Masterful. A truly remarkable experience that is worth every penny. Wonderful food, attentive and friendly service, beautiful wine pairings. If you're in San Sebastian, you must come here!"
"An incredible experience celebrating our wedding, thank you so much Elena for making it even more special"
"We recently went to Azurmendi in Bilbao and Martin Berasategui in San Sebastian and had incredible dinners there. We've also eaten exceptional meals around the world. We know what great food is. This was far from it. Our meal at Arzak was average at best. We had forgettable starters, a prawn, three pieces of hake neck, some lamb loins, an underseasoned egg dish... I could go on. Nothing special or even interesting. The servers were stiff and unfriendly. The place has zero charm and shockingly poor value for money. Maybe when the dad was there, the place was special. I'm dubious but maybe. But I know the Michelin people need to return and reassess the place before more people squander their hard-earned money on this totally mediocre place."
"I've never eaten at a Michelin 3 star restaurant before. Unfortunately I've been dealing with a stomach bug since I arrived in San Sebastian. I thought I recovered just in time but as I progressed I was hit by sudden uneasiness and nausea and had to stop halfway. I felt terrible but the staff were so very kind and ended the meal early for me at no charge and served me some herbal tea to settle myself. My party continued and I was able to observe. What I had tasted was absolutely sublime, like a symphony orchestra in your mouth. Very simple flavors profiles but layered and textured in such creative ways that really blew my mind. It's food that makes you think. There's nothing here with objectionable taste or texture, everything is executed impeccably and beautifully. Service here is amazing. There is a reason this is a 3 star restaurant and there is no doubt in my mind that rating is deserved. I can't think of any reason that you wouldn't try to eat here at least once in your life, definitely eat here if you are going to be in the region."
"Cannot say enough good things. Service is absolutely exceptional from the moment you walk in. Menu was local, fresh, flavors were incredible and all told a story. Sommelier was fantastic, chose a great reasonably priced bottle of local white, and a great glass of red to pair with the meat. Elena came out and greeted all of the tables and was a lovely person. Left very full and very happy."
"A great place with 3 stars.the parking is limited and difficult so take a taxi
."
"Exceed all expectations. Our server suggested subbing out certain dishes for others on the tasting menu to get a more expansive experience, which was very nice. Extra bonus.. Elena came out to chat with each table towards the end of the night!"
"Unbelievable. Unbelievably bad, that is. Does not make sense given its reputation. To say that dinner service was a comedy of errors would not be too harsh. Many of the dishes felt like outcomes of a game the chefs played where they had to draw three ingredients from a hat. Dessert was the only saving grace - these were delicious and inventive."
"Food and service outdated and especially the wine-experience was very low. Somellier guy did not speak english and just gave us option of ""red or white?"". For bottles priced over €100 you want to know more about the wine. Compare to the restaurants in San Sebastian on the 50-best-list the level here is too low."
"Hmmm... I don't know about this place.  I suppose it is the definition of old school.  We went to Atrio in  Caceres a few days earlier and it was less than half the price and 10 times the creativity.  Having said that, everything sweet:  two desserts, a variety of chocolates and truffles were off the charts."
A good dining experience with my friends in Arzak. Impressive quality and work for the Degustation Menu. Not a 5/5 for 2 reasons : service a bit messy for food and wines (poor explanations) & the pairing really too expensive for the wine …
"The food was excellent, the wine pairing even better. Service in general - and especially Davide and Adolfo - were very accommodating and attentive."
"Exceptionally serviced tasting menu with top to bottom perfection on the food and wine pairings. We dined with a 16 month old and the staff were more than accommodating, providing her own portions and helping us setup an additional chair when our little one knocked out for a nap. I would be happy to award full honors for the service alone, but the food was equally  enjoyable. It was an honor to shake hands with Juan Marie Arzak before leaving and I wish this team the best!"
"I came with such expectations for the legendary restaurant. Sadly they’re trapped in the past. Would never receive three stars today, and some of the sloppiness makes me even question if they’d receive one (creased menus?!). Lovely staff, but need to try harder."
"Eh. Did a tour of Spain with my husband hitting up some of the best restaurants and this was one. It was okay, none of the dishes really wowed me or made me want more. Service was not great, they just weren't very attentive. If I were to go again, I'd skip this."
"The food is not bad but given the quality of food in San Sebastian, it's hard to consider the value of what you're getting.
We got the the tasting menu and were very glad that we could chop and change some of the dishes to others on the menu. The experience was quite pleasant with Elena coming out and having a brief chat. Asir the Maitre d was lovely and explained the restaurant, it's cuisine and ingredients very well.
Overall, save the money on the wonderful pinxtos bars instead."
"This restaurant is over-rated  , bread was cold & not properly presented .
Food was so so & i really can’t accept that slow cook onzen egg was over-cooked for a famous 3 michelin star restaurant. Ingredients are not special . Really not worth to try . Many restaurants in San Sabastian can do much better ."
"I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said, but this is a very special place, worth a pilgrimage. Service is stellar, wine selection is brilliant, and the food is mind-blowing. Unlike some Avant Guard restaurants, the experimentation has been conducted behind the scenes, in advance, and not on the patrons."
We were lucky and got a lunch reservation on short notice. Excellent food and great service. Wine recommendation was very good and well priced. Paid about 500 Euro for 2 persons and consider this very good value for money.
"Gracious and welcoming; wonderful service; superb food, innovative, every bite- delicious!"
"The most amazing meal that I have ever had! Impeccable service without the stuffiness that one might expect in a place of such high quality. The hours flew by: we were booked for 21:30 and it was 01:00 before we knew it. We had the tasting menu with local wines recommend by the sommelier. Every single dish was a sensation, with flavour combinations that one wouldn't necessarily have expected, that not only worked, but made everyone's eyes light up in surprise."
We had a great and happy dinner at Arzak! The food is solid and we can see lots of effort are put into each course. The service is great and very welcoming. We got the chance to talk to chef Elena and she is very kind. We liked almost every course. It's a top recommendation in this city for high dining lovers.
"Disappointing. The food was nothing special, nice presentation though but bland in taste. The sommelier pushed so hard his favorite wine that we didn't have a choice. Wine was ok but not our main choice. The atmosphere inside is very cold and awkwardly silent.

There are so many outstanding restaurants in the Basque Country, don't spend your money on this overrated venue."
"amazing place, amazing staff, amazing food, Amazing wine. if you get a opportunity just go don't wait it I'll be  worth it!

we had the tasting menu and the apetiffs just arrive in a rapid tempo whit small taste explosions one after another.

then the starters arrive in a bit slower tempo whit even higher taste levels and it just keeps coming good looking and good tasting dishes. out of 10 dishes it was one that I thught dident came up to same level as the rest of the food ( egg dish ) but far away from bad.

then dessert whit nutswas one of the best tastes i ever experience.

and a special thanks to the head waiter that just made our visit to something extra!

I I'll be back that's a promise"
The food was superb and the staff very attentive and friendly. But the service was a bit careless sometimes. They poured wine in the water glass and the water carafe was broken with sharp edges. We expected more from a three star restaurant.
Nice to see Mr Arzak come out and talked to each table.
"Life time experience to remember in terms of food, atmosphere, service. Michelin rated"
It's OK. I feel like the food was good but it's like a 1 -2 star Michelin quality place. Not 3. Some dishes were too heavy on the vinegar
"Chefs Arzak need no introduction.  Their creation is a work of art, so delicate, so thoughtful and so delicious. They have wonderfully used special ingredients from all over the world like ají, mole and capuchina to create dishes that combines these ingredients very well.
The chefs and staff here are so welcoming, making the overall experience a memorable one."
"SIMPLY STUNNING

Had a wonderful dinner here and enjoyed every dish from the tasting menu. Absolutely amazing and faultless dishes with exceptional service to match.
Arzak is 'the restaurant' to go to in San Sebastian. Truly amazing and deserving of all 3 Michelin Stars. You will not regret it."
Good but nothing impressive as what you would normally expect out of a 3 star… complacent 2nd generation that runs this on the established brand name…
"We hit up a San Pelligrino list restaurant, or sometimes a couple, every year for our anniversary. We went to Spain this year primarily to go to Tickets. That's a great experience in and of itself but I'll stick to Arzak.

We made the trip to San Sebastian and Arzak almost as an afterthrought. It was great. In fact, it was my wife's favorite meal of all time and not the many world class restaurants we've hit up over the years. The service was good, if not exceptional. The restaurant environment and ambiance has a good vibe. The wine selection was okay; the glasses are limited. The food however was the key. The presentation was excellent and there was not an ""eh"" or bad serving on the tasting menu. The whole experience was delicious. Highly recommend."
"Very creative, artful, colorful, rich in substance. The staff is welcoming, friendly, working like bees to satisfy all tables. The menu de dégustation is smart and flexible as one can choose, and the quantity leaves a person satisfied, not over stuffed, a wide selection of wine is good."
"Hospitality is what Arzak does best. Many restaurants can do good, beautiful food but they cannot all create the atmosphere. The staff were all excellent and accomodating, making sure to let you know what if anything wasn't quite right or if we didn't like the taste, then they would sort it. They offered to swap dishes in the tasting menu if we weren't so keen and the same with the wine after we had opened and tried it. Of course, we didn't need to do, the wine chosen was excellent and the dishes all sounded so interesting, we didn't want to swap anything.

It is not as refined as some may expect for a 3 Michelin star i.e. it is not silver service but if it was, it wouldn't have the same atmosphere and personality.

I found the food to be good but it didn't blow me away. I can only put this down to some flavours just not being for me. I am still glad that I went and I still would reccomend Arzak to all."
"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary there in September of 2018. Amazing experience. The food was beyond expectation, the atmosphere perfect and the service exceptional. Cezar is a true professional as our culinary concierge."
"I got a trip to this 3 star Michelin resuturant as a gift and I have to say this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The food was amazing, the service was amazing. We even got a visit frol the chef herself. An experience I will thresher forever."
"Amazing experience at Arzak, the staff and sommelier are fantastic and helpful. The staff made few errors on the night but nothing material and they were resolved swiftly. We had the tasting menu and every single dish was beautifully presented and equally tasted beautifully. The wines are reasonable and we opted for a local red which was fantastic."
"I enjoyed a very memorable lunch at Arzak recently.  The food was very, very good and the service, for the most part, on point with what you’d expect in a restaurant of this calibre.

I liked the choice of a la carte or tasting menu options, from which I ultimately chose a tasting menu—each dish was a delight.

As you’d expect they also have a very extensive wine list, although no wine pairing options, however, to offer with the tasting menu, which I find can make it easier to work out what to drink. That didn’t matter as the very helpful sommelier was able to recommend some delicious and surprisingly good value wines by the glass to accompany the tasting menu I chose.

Several times during our visit I saw the owner, Juan Mari, and his daughter Elena, enter the dining room to greet guests and check on their experience. Elena stopped at our table and introduced herself, which was great and something you don’t always see in other three star restaurants.

Well worth a visit if you’re into fine dining and want to experience a highly creative Basque cuisine."
"Just had a lunch that we will remember for a long, long time. A real thrill to meet the chef Elena Arzak. The host, somm and waitstaff was a lesson in how to do it all correctly. Friendly and humorous interplay with us while providing blow out, great food. A wine list any serious restaurant would be proud of and with reasonable prices. As it should be, a little difficult to book but we did with some perseverance. If you are serious about experiencing what a starred restaurant can achieve, go."
"Amazing three star Michelin restaurant in San Sebastián. Service, food and wine is always unbelievable and the flavors couldn't be better. It is definitely worth the trip alone to go there."
"A wonderful experience. The food was amazing, the wine delicious and the hospitality second to none. If we could give 10 stars we would! A must do for anyone interested in great food."
"Got the tasting menu for my fiances bday and I have mixed emotions about this place. I liked that they were flexible with their menu and allowed us to choose so we could taste different dishes. Service was great and Elena came and chatted in the end which was a nice touch. They also brought a massive mousse cake with a candle that was so delicious and rich so I was very happy with that.

The food and the ambience however wasn't worth what we paid for. No background music to create that ambience and the set up of the place was underwhelming. Just a standard modern looking restaurant.

We have been ticking the top 50 restaurants in the world and also other top restaurants in Melbourne Australia and this did not even compare. For EUR440 for 2 ppl and extra EUR100 (AUD900 all up) for alcohol I was disappointed. The food was creative just like a top restaurant but there were some dishes that I wasnt a fan off. The crab dish looked like vomit in a bowl literally. I couldnt eat it. The macarel dish was too mushy with no other texture. The pigeon was truffly which was good but didnt like the mushy jelly like pate served with it and the granita dessert in the end while refreshing, was lazy and an average serve for a top resto. Other restos would serve that as a palate cleanser.

Mugaritz in San Seb, Azurmendi in Bilbao and Vue du Monde in Melbourne is on par with pricing but definitely way beyond Arzaks flavour profiles, ambience and restaurant theme."
Incredible! The tasting menu with matched wines was one of the best I have had in the world. The pigeon and white tuna belly were exceptional as were the wines
"Colorful, creative and delicious.  It's inventive but  I wouldn't qualify it as entirely unique nor off the charts.  Some of the dishes were gimmicky, the tv under the glass plate, for instance.  The skateboard?  All well and good but the food has to really shine and it didn't always.  The sommelier was the reason I dropped this rating to 3.  Entirely rushed, too busy to take any time for questions about the wine and blurted out his answers while closing the wine menu to end our discussion.  Fortunately our sever recognized our disappointment in that engagement and stepped in to fill in the gaps left by his lack of service.  A surprising miss considering the Michelin 3 star rating."
"One of the best meal I have ever had. The sommelier was amaizing, paired the wine perfectly. The atmosphere was beautiful and classy,Elena giving insight to the creation of the meals added to the experience."
5/5. Contrary to what I have read before in some of the reviews they do offer a wine pairing for their tasting menu. The food was very good and the presentation was beautiful. The wines from the wine pairing matched the dishes very well.
"The creativity of the food presentation n the flavors are not to be missed. U can’t say u have been to San Sabastian until u have a meal here. I was a little hesitant to go as I was by myself n a little intimidated by its reputation. I’m so glad I went. The food was outstanding n fun, the service great, n they made u feel comfortable. They explained everything n willing to be as helpful in ordering as u need,with recommendations on wine to portion size. You need to make reservations 2 to 4 months in advance. U can do it through their website or over the phone. Chef Juan Arzak is viewed as a national treasure by the Spaniard n one of the reasons San Sabaistian is viewed as one of the great cities in the world for its food. Elena Arzak the daughter stoped by during the meal n said hi.  She was just awarded best woman chef in the world. U can only hope one of her children also has the passion that this family has for making wonderful food. I did go to other great resturants (also 3 Michelin star)in San Sabastian n the food was outstanding,  u just didn’t want it to end, but this is Arzak!  Don’t miss the opertunity."
Amazing food and staff!  This is a special treat for sure.  The local wine suggestion by the sommelier was excellent.  The sampling (degustation) menu was the right choice.  Best restaurant in the best foodie city!
"Excellent presentation, but very expensive food that left no lasting impression. Can’t help but wonder if all other reviews raving about this place are in denial about blowing good money for nothing. So sad."
"Arzak did not meet my expectations; although the food was good (especially the lamb and the pigeon) it was not very special / innovative, no wow factor. The St Pellegrino website said the restaurant had a great view but there was no view.

Although the restaurant has been in the Arzak family for ages, it did not feel as a family restaurant and the interior of the restaurant was very modern and rather cold.

One dish was served on an extremely old Philips tablet which was a bit odd and did not add to the experience.

The staff was nice however their English language skills were rather limited which probably added to our (lack of) experience.

Many other restaurants in the area which I would check out before going to Arzak."
"Great food, but no real surprises. Overall assessment reduced by very limited (poor)  wine service for this level. No choices possible by the glass."
Elena is brilliant in the kitchen and charming in person. I must go if you are in San Sebastián!
Magnificent and sublime. Even if expensive the service and quality is absolutely worth it. The menu is highly recommended
It deserves to be in the top of the list of all restaurants in the world. Excellent food. Elena Arzak are the best chef and host in Spain. Chapeau!
"Unless you are close to being penniless, and even then find some way, do not even contemplate spending time in Donostia-San Sebastián without going to Arzak. This restaurant is, in so many ways, what a good restaurant should be and deliver. It does deliver!

Sometimes when you have high expectations and, why wouldn’t you, because Elena Arzak has presently been voted the top female chef in the world. After lunching there several weeks ago it did not come at all as a surprise. From the time, we stepped in the front door to the time we were escorted out of the front door the service; the food, the staff, the ambience, the décor and the experience were faultless. The restaurant is presently undergoing renovation on the outside so it was a little unprepossessing when we arrived. However, as soon as we stepped inside all of that was swept away.
We were fortunate enough to have Elena come out and take us for a tour of the kitchen. It was a reliable indication in its calm orderly and efficient atmosphere of the gastronomic experience to follow. I think that was prompted by my wife having been to one of her master classes in Melbourne. The world is a small place. Elena had purchased one of her favourite dresses from Lisa Gorman in Melbourne. Lisa lives 100 meters down the street from us. However, back to the experience.

After being seated in the restaurant, Elena was gracious enough to make some suggestions and variations on her degustation menu. I have attached a copy of that menu, and frankly, I would have been happy to eat anything from it. As my wife does not drink red wine we generally compromise on Rosé. Arzak have their in-house Rosé, which is delightfully dry and crisp. It was a more than a satisfactory match for the food. Sometimes life is a compromise, for that matter, so is marriage.
Elena is married to an architect who has overseen a wonderfully understated renovation of the restaurant. The wait staff was attentive and professional without being obsequious. They were pleased to explain the dishes, which came at a perfect pace.

We were fortunate to meet Elena’s father who started this restaurant and who still greets the customers at each table. Elena herself is articulate, extremely friendly and quietly in complete control of her establishment.
I am thrilled we went for lunch, not because I think the evening meal or experience would be any less, but simply it did give me the chance to digest one of the best meals I have ever tasted and to have time to think about it before going to bed on a full stomach. Seriously, do not leave town without going to Arzak."
"Very disappointing! We were expecting a breathtaking experience but we were unimpressed by the place. Furthermore, the 487 euros we spent in this gastronomic journey were not good value. Arzac is so overvalued and quite old fashion.
But let's be more precise. We took the degustation menu. The starters were the worst. Tasteless and without imagination. The main dishes were really good, the dessert also but overall the experience was not worth the price we paid. We were expecting so much more. If you compare, let's say, with Akelarre it's quite laughable. We don't recommend it. For the same price, go to Mugaritz or Akelarre."
I was never a Michelin expert but the food here was amazing and presentation was incredible.  I would rank it one if the best tasting menus I've ever had.
"The food was good and the service was nice. I think it's a bit overrated...  But overall, we had a good meal there."
"Fresh off the high of excellent fine dining in Barcelona (Disfrutar, Tickets, Enigma), I was looking forward to my first three Michelin star experience in Spain. Not only does Arzak have three stars, it’s one of the rare World's 50 Best Restaurants to be headed by a female chef (no. 31 of 50). I even skipped Mugaritz (no. 9) the day before to give my stomach a break and fully appreciate the tasting menu at Arzak.

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with my lunch tasting menu experience. The food was fine, but not amazing - I enjoyed the small plates and desserts much more than the main courses which felt too flashy, yet uninspired and dated. A course came out on a color-changing tablet - money that could have been better spent on say, nicer wine glasses instead of their clunky ones.

What really let me down though were the sexist undertones. The sexism of the restaurant industry and general condoning of abusive behavior is no secret, but this was the first time I've actually felt uncomfortable as a diner at a fine dining establishment.

In contrast to confident females that were our primary servers at the other aforementioned restaurants, the female staff here seemed relegated to second-class citizens. They barely made eye contact or spoke, only serving to fold napkins with spoons (no hands allowed) and clear plates. A female stage chef hinted at her unhappiness and how she needed to think carefully about where to continue her career.

As for myself, I also experienced some interesting moments. I was taking notes in a small notebook, and the male maître d' asked my husband if he were a chef. Now it isn't a huge leap to see a diner take handwritten notes and assume they work in the industry, but I was the one taking notes here, not my husband. I guess I was the secretary?

Throughout the meal, the same maître d' was very alpha in his mannerisms. When I didn't finish the overcooked monkfish, he absolutely insisted I have another fish course. He was so confident I would eventually find one I liked.

After the multi-fish course ordeal, came the pigeon nonsense. When ordering, I said I wasn't a fan of pigeon, but the maître d' asserted that the pigeon was their star dish, so I got pigeon as my second main course. The female server that cleared my plate showed the nearly untouched remains to the maître d'. Of course he then came over and wanted me to have another course, but this time I had enough and didn't give in.

Right after this, Juan Mari Arzak (joint head chef with his daughter Elena) came over to greet the table, and Mr. Maître d' whispered into his ear (in front of us and twice!) about the pigeon. Juan didn't seem disappointed by that though, he was too busy calling me ""nice"" and pinching my cheek - yes he actually pinched my cheek! Elena, who I actually wanted to meet, was out of town.

After this experience and the forgettable food, I can't recommend Arzak. For other fine dining in San Sebastian, Asador Etxebarri is at the top of my must-try list. It's about an hour outside of the city and has nothing but rave reviews from everyone I've talked to personally, including the head chef at Enigma. My husband also enjoyed his solo experience at Mugaritz the day before."
Simple amazing food served by amazing staff - such a lovely and enjoyable evening!
Amazing food and a very gracious host. Thank you  Elena!
"Arzak has lived in my imagination for years. To have now eaten the food created by a man that was like a father to Anthony Bourdain, one of my heroes, is an experience I won't soon forget. Elena's creativity is a revelation and truly life-affirming. I feel incredibly lucky to have eaten here. World class cuisine is an understatement."
"While in San Sebastián, Spain, This restaurant is a MUST!! The Experience is unique, the food incredible and very upscale. I loved it!!"
"One of the best dining I've experienced and I also goto the chance to have a picture with the Chef Arzak himself. Ammazing people, amazing service, amazing food. Just fantastic."
Go for the a la carte menu and do half-portions. 3 half portions + a half dessert portion is more than enough if you're hungry. Otherwise 2 half portions + half a dessert portion is enough too. The pigeon and tuna dishes are top
Predictably brilliant. Perfect combination of flavors in the tasting menu. Friendly and attentive service. Worth the (rather steep) price.
"Incredible experience and cuisine, even got a chance to speak to Juan Mari and Elena as they walked through the dining room. A must in San Sebastian."
"Attentive, friendly, polite and absolutely nice service. Eating in this restaurant is an experience of sensations and senses that make the stay unforgettable. Congratulations!"
We went to Akelarre and Martin Berasatagui in our trip to San Sebastián. While Arzak was a very nice  meal it wasn’t in the same league of these other places. The food was good but didn’t blow us away and the service was sub par for what you would expect at this level of restaurant. If you can’t get a booking at either of the other two restaurants mentioned you will still have a great meal at this place howevr it is prob not quite up there with the other high end restaurants in town.
"I have to commend Elena Arzak for successfully balancing the reputation of her father, who is now just a distant memory, from the new cooking she has brought in. While the team is still largely the same: Mariano, the sommelier, has been working there for 38 years, the dishes bring a fantastic new wave of ideas and flavors. Wonderful work and Arzak is back on my top list."
"3 Michelin star, the Bocuse of Spain.  Building, food philosophy and dishes and plating reflects a different era. literally the most famous restaurant in San Sebastian."
"The best of best I've tasted so far. Presentation top class, taste or combination of tastes to kill for, friendly and professional guys serving dishes or let me rephrase, serving design."
Excellent in all ways. Food and service were above anything I ever experienced. Thanks for the great evening!
"Went for the tasting menu and two glasses of wine, sommelier’s choices. Outstanding."
Three star food and service. As you would expect. No real wow factor though.
Three star but very down to earth staff and crew. Food was sublime (as expected). Get the tasting menu!
"Great food, great service, Elena is wonderful and makes a really nice connection with the customers"
"Legendary restaurant by Juan Mari Arzak. Stayed true to its roots with unusual but great flavor combinations such as mango with squid and beer, sardines and strawberries etc."
One of the best places to eat in the world. We can’t wait to go back.
"Fantastic meal. Everything was delicious and well presented and it's what you imagine a fancy, world-famous restaurant to be like."
"Fantastic meal hitting all of our taste buds. Presentation, service and experience well worth it."
the food and service was very good but im not sure it was up to the reputation.
Excellent.  We enjoyed this much more than Akelarre. They were very accommodating and altered their degustation menu for my wife.
Extremely pricey but probably one of my favorite meals ever. Unbelievably extensive wine list!
"Amazing flavor profiles, spectacular presentations and superior service. Gastronomic experience not to be missed!!!!"
"So creative, so delicious. An amazing cooperation of father and his daughter. A must while in San Sebastian."
"Incredible. It is all about the food here, no messing around...worth every euro. Glad I had the chance of trying it!"
From all the fine dining experiences I had in Spain this one stood out for the superb food and warmth in service.
"Lots of effort put into every dishes, but it could have been a bit simpler also to keep the original taste."
One of the most extraordinary experiences I -- and my family -- have ever had.  Elena Arzak and her team are amazing!
Michelin star restaurant that deserves each and every star. Every details has been considered and the food was tasty and filling.
An amazing experience! I have no words for this amazing restaurant
Had a nice dinner but were not blown away like you would expect from the name and reputation.
One of the best culinary experiences I have had !
Very good and innovative food. A pricey and yet deserving experience
"This place has fantasticly tasty food, is famous and is strongly recomended!😎👍👍👍👍👍 …"
"Soooooo lovely People, soooooo lovely food, service and  Winelist, well Worth evry penny 🍷 …"
"Good food,  but a little overrated and pricey for the number of dishes you get (I would prefer a larger number of smaller sized dishes)."
"Really disappointed food presentation, quality & unprofessional service with wrongly pouring still & sparking water😓 not expected in a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant! …"
To say this was an experience of a lifetime would be an understatement.  I have never experienced anything like it .
"Truly memorable cuisine, service and experience! Highly recommend Arzak for any occasion as our experience was superb."
Spectacular experience. Love the attention to detail and food presentation. Gracious
"this was such a disappointing meal after going to 11MP, the service was not great and the food to me just missed the mark."
One of the best restaurants to learn about Basque food and have a premium food experience.
"Food, staff and ambience create an outstanding experience... Don't wait, book!"
The best restaurant in Spain and one of the best in the world. A legend.
"If you don't mind the price, which is completely adequate for the quality, it is completely recommended"
One of the best gastonomic experiences in my life. Thank you
"Just love this Restaurant, the food is excellent, service outstanding!!!"
Pricey but worth it for the experience. Service was also amazing.
Over the top experience. The best 3 stars I’ve been too!
Absolutely incredible. A meal you'll be talking about for years.
"It's excellent!!!
They are very attentive, you will not regret it"
Fantastic. Marvelous. Very good. A very special experience for the senses. It's a shame I can't go more often.
"You have to go, a classic of new Basque cuisine."
"Everything perfect, I would return to the place.. very nice"
It is A1 attention ☺️ and delicious food recommended to the general public ☺️
"It is a nice place, recommended to enjoy with your family."
"It has been a delicious experience in every way. We have discovered new flavors, some surprising. We found the attention of the staff to be special and cared for, without being invasive, they make you feel at home. That has been a plus that we have not found in other restaurants of this level. One recommendation I could make is to give more importance or more emphasis to the olfactory part of the dishes. In some, it was perceived but in others perhaps a little neutral. Thanks for an unforgettable night!"
"It is a restaurant with a lot of prestige earned over many years of work and doing things very well. In our case we went for a celebration and were invited by our children. From the first moment we were treated discreetly, quickly, lovingly and very efficiently. The tasting menu is very extensive and exquisite. With surprising dishes and other more recognizable ones, in any case very well prepared and served. We left delighted and we will remember it as something very special."
"I know her daughter from the times I have been here, but not her famous father, but I can say about her that she was treated unbeatably and with a lot of education.

In this restaurant I don't order from the menu, nor from the typical tasting menu, but what I do is always take advice because they are usually right and completely right.

The day of the Tamborrada El Maestro is truly a spectacle and really animates the party. It is a shame that it is extremely difficult to reserve that day since the diners on that day come back practically all of them, absolutely every year.

The treatment by the staff is unbeatable, not a gentleman's treatment, it is a friendly approach that is greatly appreciated.

I highlight the quality of the products they use in all their dishes, although there are dishes that I don't like, it's not because of them, it's just because there are some things that I don't like, but the people I've been to tell me they are incredible.

I love that mix of traditional Basque with touches of modernity that they experience every year. What I do see as very positive is that year after year they want to improve and they do not stagnate or rest on their laurels.

I have to highlight a great selection of wines that they have."
"We had a tasting menu and were not disappointed. From the starter appetizer to the desserts, all the dishes are delicious, original and surprising, at least for me. Well explained. The different and beautiful tableware. The unbeatable attention. All staff attentive.
The price is high, but what you receive in return, in my opinion, is worth it."
Magical place I hope to return soon with my family
"From the attention upon arrival, to the visit to the winery, the staff, 10.
Especially Adolfo and Mariano, the sommelier.
Exceptional food.
It's a shame that it takes us so far away and that it's so expensive.
But is it worth it.
These enjoyments raise morale.
Ah! I forgot. We ate at the table next to the kitchen, watching the pace and pace of the staff.
Unforgettable"
Very good food in my opinion the best of the best
"We went there 15 years ago. The daughter has taken over the kitchen which is, even more than before, refocused on highlighting the product – abandoning certain post-molecular kitchen gadgets to return to a certain classicism. Appetizers and magnificent fish, including a very simple carabinero (in two cookings all the same), an anthology. The meat dishes and desserts have a little less personality. Superb list of Spanish wines at reasonable prices. most bottles are offered for less than 100 euros, and many even for less than 70 euros. We would like the French three-stars to take an example…"
Cooks to a standard as high as expected. No. 1
"It looks good, when I have the opportunity I will visit them"
Very eager to be part of the services that the client provides us.
"It is a 3 Michelin star restaurant for a reason. The service is spectacular, the food is very very delicious, some dishes on the tasting menu are surprising but the final feeling is like something is missing for the price it is (very high, you can see it on the website). I left the restaurant, not hungry, but with the feeling that I could have eaten more. A lot more. The truth is that they give options to change dishes depending on tastes or allergies so it is flexible but for my taste there are not enough dishes, in other restaurants of this type they are more numerous and substantial.
Still spectacular."
"I have eaten the tasting menu and the truth is that I was disappointed because it wasn't bad because it wasn't. If not, because if you go to a 3 star restaurant for a 250 euro menu, I think you have to go out trying different flavors and the only thing really different was the fish of the day and the fish was not the size of your little toe in 3 parts. I have been to others like stretxo and I still remember each dish. Of course, the treatment was very exclusive and they were very attentive to us at all times and in the end they told us if we wanted to repeat any dish."
"Unbeatable, fantastic, an incredible experience. It is eating art, enjoying each surprising bite of impressive dishes that look like paintings in an art gallery. I will never forget it, you have to experience it."
"Saying ""magnificent"" is the expression I want to use to define today's experience.
Being there at the top, not day after day, but year after year, is not free.
But one of the things that has impressed me the most, apart from its great cuisine and culinary daring, has been the close and humane treatment of the staff, something that is not always linked to this type of restaurant where the distance between customer and service They are a little separated, while still being an exquisite treatment.
Thank you Arzak for this magical moment that you have offered us"
"Possibly it is a question of expectations, which were many.
I was not surprised by the flavors or textures as one expects when going to a restaurant of this type.
Some dishes did not improve the classic preparation of the products.
The presentations could be improved, more pretentious than elegant.
The desserts are the best."
"Disappointing experience!
We are an Italian couple who travel a lot, we recently decided to spend a few days in the Basque country also to enjoy the excellence of the three three-starred restaurants located within a radius of a few kilometres. Without a doubt the TOP was Azurmendi as the location, the presentation of each dish (I repeat ""every dish"") was perfect and unforgettable! Each dish was a tableau of top marks! 360 degree perfection.
Instead at Arzak, the presentation was rather banal and nothing surprised our palate.
I feel I can express this opinion because we are regular customers of Alajmo in Padua and Venice in Italy (Alajmo with ""le Calandre"" is always a three-starred restaurant), originality and excellence reign here too.
In my opinion, a three-star restaurant must absolutely amaze with every course and above all it must NEVER be banal. At Arzak, among the various courses, 14 in total, unfortunately I have no memory of any dish. The owner Elena is very kind, like all the dining room staff who showered us with attention but the style of the dishes is not up to the level of the young owner of Azurmendi, so all the kind attention from Arzak is not followed up in the rest, which instead it is fundamental.

Barasategui restaurant is positioned halfway between these two. Some dishes are definitely special and stand out. The location is also suggestive with an excellent wine list.

I would like to point out that a three-star restaurant must be like a 5-star hotel where NOTHING is given to chance, where it is the detail that makes the difference. The originality of the flavour, the refinement of the product, the decoration of the dish must NEVER be banal. The ""wow"" exclamation at every course must be guaranteed in a three-star restaurant... just like what happened to us at Azurmendi. If there is a fair criterion, we really don't understand how Arzak can have three stars like the other two...!
Sara & Carmine"
"The restaurant is surprisingly friendly considering it's a 3-star Michelin restaurant, and the interior is surprisingly crowded.
There is a wine list that is as thick as a dictionary, so I think it would be a good idea to ask for recommendations that go well with that day's cuisine.
The old sommelier is a little unfriendly, but he has a professional atmosphere and a nice atmosphere.
The chef will go around each table and chat with you, so I think it will be fun to ask a lot of questions. They also accept photo shoots.

I headed there by rental car, but the parking lot behind the store was narrow and sloped, so it was quite difficult.
On the way back, the car will be brought to the front of the store instead of volleyball style."
"The best cuisine in the world, the tastiest and most original dishes that can be tasted. The decoration is very cozy and all the people who work there make you feel welcome in their home, thanks to them the experience becomes sublime and perfect."
"Comparable to Michelin one-star restaurants (Montia and Yugo), and nothing comparable to 3-star restaurants like Aponiente. The menu is acceptable, however, it does not surprise in flavors or textures or creativity. It is easy to make a good dish with a good product. If you put it at half price, it would still be excessive."
A prestigious restaurant that has been around for many years and is an institution in its food.
"Incredible experience. They adapted each and every one of the dishes to my food allergies without losing the flavor or the way of preparation. Delicious food, great service, the chef came to greet us in person and visited all the tables. It is much more than going to dinner at a restaurant. An experience for all the senses. Absolutely recommended."
"Beautiful...disappointment
If the cooking was all just right, no nice surprises worthy of a triple star, nothing exceptional on our plates, not to mention the sommelier who was really uncommunicative and not at all attentive. Appetizers served fifteen minutes after the cocktail and sweets with the bill. Really disappointed! Unanimous opinion of the four guests, shared by the neighboring table."
"Excellent. A restaurant of 10. Explosion of flavors on the palate. We loved the tasting menu.
Elena very attentive and close.
Exceptional service, treatment, food and place.
Thanks for everything! See you soon."
Attention A1 in every aspect meets all the demands of its guests
"The best possible menu.
An experience to enjoy with care. Taking your time.
Gastronomically impeccable. One can expect that, but what impresses the client is the relaxing space and the exceptional service of all the employees of the Arzak family and especially Adolfo. Thank you."
"It's a 3-star Michelin restaurant where you feel at home. The menu is pleasant to eat, nothing exaggerated. The meeting between sophistication and lightness"
"Personally, the day I was there I was not happy at all. The tables very close to each other. The service I received that day, I don't know if it was a disastrous coincidence. The food only amazed me with the amazing cromlech and the deconstruction of the dessert, some chocolate screws with different shapes. Price quality is not worth it or it was a coincidence that the day I went. 2 people 380 euros."
"We are very disappointed with our meal at Arzak! We are French and have been having lunch in a 3 star restaurant for our wedding anniversary for over 15 years. It was our first experience in Spain and we were very disappointed by this Arzak restaurant, as much by the setting, the service as the gastronomy. We can say overall that it was good but nothing exceptional, nothing like what one would expect from a 3 star restaurant. The price, on the other hand, is indeed that of a three star, and even rather expensive for a three star. Compared to our visit to Madrid, we had dinner in a 2-star restaurant, Ramon Freixa, and it was really top notch, nothing to complain about, everything was really of a very good standard, it's unbeatable value for money!"
"A luxury restaurant, the decoration and the sober but at the same time intimate place. For me, the best thing was the treatment of the staff, informing us at all times of the content of the culinary delights that were served to us at all times. The food is very elaborate with a multitude of nuances. At first you think you will be hungry but it is difficult to finish all the chef's proposals. Congratulations to the Arzaks and all the members of this magnificent restaurant."
"Impressive details. Excellent food. A fantastic place and you can certainly see all the work behind this wonderful experience. Kudos to Elena, and her entire team, so kind and professional."
"The magic of cooking with excellent products, impeccable service and everything at a very high level with new creations every day put at a higher level.
Both the winery and the room deserve an outstanding rating that fascinates the diner."
"It's amazing that the person who answers the phone in such a restaurant in the Basque Country does not know Basque.
It's amazing that in a Basque restaurant of that size I couldn't understand Basque on the phone."
"The tasting menu was good, as could not be less in this category, but both the service and the dishes are below this level."
"Two of us went to eat in September 2019. They put us at a table next to the elevator, which we didn't like at all, it kept opening and closing. There were four at the next table, one a child who, although you already know he is a child, when you have a reservation at Arzak, expect not to have any children's commotion, and lastly, and I suppose that cannot be changed, that day he was not there. the owner, we would have liked to meet him"
The restaurant does not deserve three stars. The wines were excellent. The service and food and location was not up to par.
"The Arzak is absolutely perfect in every way. The food is varied and great, the wine list is impressive on around 120 pages, the prices are fair, sometimes only 10% above EK and the crowning glory is that every wish is fulfilled without any problems and without any fuss. Very impressive."
"Quality cuisine explosion of flavors, aromas and textures. And applied art presentations. And the service at the level of the cuisine, exquisite as well as close and familiar."
Fine gourmet. I didn't like it at all. No greenery. No vegetables. No starchy foods. Only traces or tiny ones. In the end for me a simple tasting of fish or meat dishes with spices at exorbitant prices. Very disapointed. The only positive point is the kindness of the service.
"The food is wonderful, an experience for the senses. The treatment of the staff is at the same level, a 10. The tasting menu is well worth it for its price."
One of my favorites among my favorites. I have eaten at Arzak several times and have never been disappointed. In fact I have had the honor of eating in his kitchen. Everything 10 except the bill that the diners have to pay...
Beautiful creative dishes. Delicious for both the eyes and the tongue. He responds sincerely to various requests. Only the sommelier is a bit disappointing.
"Spectacular menu, perfect service, nice nice place, and they are close father and daughter passing by the tables and asking about each diner"
We liked it a lot...traditional cuisine made with high quality products...the boss Arzak and his daughter were very friendly and close...I recommend it!
"Spectacular designer food restaurant, not suitable for all budgets but if you want to treat yourself to a gastronomic treat, don't hesitate. I recommend the tasting menu."
"Yoli and Toni made the evening very lively. The best experience, incredible."
Exquisite food. Personalized attention and we had the pleasure of meeting the Grand Master. These are things you have to do once in your life... although I was left hungry.
Perfect place for a perfect moment......the best possible service.....everything great....very well deserved 3 Michelin stars....I recommend it without a doubt....thank you for creating art with food!!!
Exquisite treatment and even better food. Without airs of grandeur in its kind and friendly staff. I wish I could go every day.
"IT'S BEEN A WHILE BUT:
In world famous Arzak:
The food was one
Catastrophe ! I can't remember anything!
And we were really looking forward to this evening?
The sommelier (je suis sommelier mois meme) was an extremely lazy sod, he found it beneath him to touch a plate or a water bottle! I had to get our very special bottle of champagne out of the ice cooler myself and refill the empty glasses, the sommelier was too busy! That's a joke, he probably didn't feel like it...
The boss and boss welcomed EVERY TABLE except ours!
A catastrophic evening
What a waste of money, never again!!!"
"An incredible experience, excellent food and wonderful, close treatment, you feel at home."
"100% recommended. Now her daughter Elena runs it and she has improved it. The menu it offers is unbeatable, as are its wines."
Great attention and service. Guarantee of quality in a traditional of good cuisine. A great team.
"Arzak lives up to its 3 stars and delivers an experience you remember. The wine selection at this restaurant is fantastic. We got 3 fantastic wines, each very different, but really good with the food we got. We had the opportunity to see the huge wine cellar. It was a big experience. I can definitely recommend everyone to stop by Arzak."
To repeat a meal that left us speechless SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!!!!! quality at a fair price
"AWESOME !!!
Spectacular Treatment, Unbeatable Service, Food...WITHOUT WORDS!!!
I recommend this Experience 100%!!!!"
"A unique experience
Very friendly.
At least once in your life you have to indulge yourself"
"Speed, service, quality and above all a curious and surprising menu."
"Simply, everything perfect! 100% recommended, a gastronomic temple without equal."
Treatment like at home. Great and the food needless to say! I will repeat!!!!
