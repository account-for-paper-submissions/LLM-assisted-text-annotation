To classify reviews as containing such a reference one out of the following four criteria needs to be identified:\n",

Personalized interactions: mentions of personalized interactions with a chef or staff member, such as a guided tour through the kitchen, self-introductions, having a conversation or chat, sharing stories, the use of jokes, or a chef visiting the table. Not included are explanations of dishes, the accommodation of changes in the menu, or complementary dishes, such as an amuse bouche.\n",

    "2. Chef’s and staff members’ first names: any reference to a chef or staff member from the reviewed restaurant by their first name, irrespective of the context in which it is used. So it does not matter whether or not the first name is associated with a personalized service. The use of a first name by itself is seen as a sign of an experienced personalized relationship. Not included are references to the first name of a chef working at another restaurant (e.g. “Our chef cooked much better than Gordon Ramsey”)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assistance with special occasions: mentions of guests celebrating special occasions (e.g. anniversaries or birthdays) in the restaurant, where a chef or staff member provided assistance or special attention. This includes guests receiving a present, such as a card, or treat for the occasion, talking with a chef or staff member about the occasion, or receiving help organizing the occasion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Literal mentions of personalized service and its equivalents: any use of terms such as “personal service”, “personal approach”, “personalized attention,” “personal warmth” or being “personable,” even if no further details are provided about the nature of the service. Not included are references to personal service in a negative way, e.g.: “We did not receive any personal service.”\n",

    "Exclude references to general good or exceptional service, including descriptions like \"phenomenal,\" \"friendly,\" or \"attentive service.\" Focus instead on instances where there is a reference to a personalized service or a personalized relationship according to one out of the four criteria outlined above. \n",

The restaurant is situated within a top hotel and specialises in Southern/South East French cuisine. Which is understandable as Chef Pic is from that heritage. My wife and I visited in July 2021 for our wedding anniversary.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe food is stupendous. Tasty. Creative. And a sight and wonder to behold. For the taste buds, the eyes, and for all the senses indeed. Furthermore, service is impeccable. The staff are friendly, professional, courteous yet impeccably trained and oh so knowledgeable on the restaurant's various dishes. Most impressive. I was most impressed by Stephanie, Art and Walter especially. Job well done! I especially liked the attention to detail by the team. Stephanie's team noticed I was on my wedding anniversary meal and took appropriate action. Most impressive! I have decided I will spend my anniversaries here every year from henceforth! Imagine if you came here to propose marriage to your loved one!\\n\\nCons: None really. Prices are fair in view of the quality of the food and establishment. Lovely high ceilings. Staff did not rush me at all. The soap dispenser on the left hand side ran out of soap in the men's toilet, but really, I can't find any flaw or fault in the restaurant. Well done!\\n\\nIn short, Dame De Pic is the London outpost of Chef Pic's international Michelin starred gastronomic empire and serves superb French food. I had a great time there, would recommend it unreservedly and look forward to visiting them again soon for great tasting French food. Well done guys!</td>\n",

This completely ruined our experience.\\n\\nAfter getting the attention of our waiter, he continued to time his pour wrong.  Finally we spoke to one of the senior managers, who informed me that the kitchen failed to communicate with front of house, and offered our cocktails on the house as an apology.\\n\\nSadly, it doesn’t rectify the failure, and at a cost in excess of £600.</td>\n",

La Dame de Pic at the opulent Four Seasons hotel at Ten Trinity square is a venue set to impress the most discerning of diners. Anne-Sophie Pic is one of the World’s most decorated female Michelin star chefs and this truly beautiful restaurant is befitting of her culinary excellence.\\n\\nUpon arrival at the Four Seasons hotel, we were instantly impressed by the tasteful grandiosity of the building. Deep carpets felt pleasing under foot and the tall walls featured an artistically crafted fresco set into the plaster. We passed garlands of fresh flowers to enter the central bar, featuring a grand piano at the middle of its lavish rounded room. This building was formerly the Port of London Authority headquarters and retains much of its original décor. La Dame de Pic features high ceilings and columns set with bevelled mirrors, bathing the restaurant with natural light. Guests are given plenty of space and seated on rich leather furniture. We got a glimpse of the intimate private room, which reflects the charm of the building and can accommodate 14 guests for a truly special dining experience. The venue is impressive without being stuffy and the warm, attentive staff are very relaxed and welcoming.\\n\\nAnne-Sophie Pic has a reputation for producing exceptional dishes and we couldn’t wait to sample her creations. The restaurant features several menu options, ranging from a set lunch menu starting at a very reasonable £32 for two Michelin Starred courses, to an indulgent six course tasting menu, for those wanting a truly heavenly experience. We picked a four-course lunch option which featured a tour de force of cooking. The fresh cheese gnocchi paired with a velvety-smooth pepper emulsion and wild mushrooms was an amazing opener. The foie gras terrine was the richest we’ve tasted, melting on the palette with a pineapple and cardamom chutney. A Scottish scallop with smoked beetroot and grapefruit was cooked to other-worldly standards, converting a former beetroot avoider to rave about this course. A duck breast smoked with vanilla was the most perfectly cooked example we’ve tasted, with the fat beautifully rendered and the meat pleasingly pink and juicy. A delicate fillet of Cornish Brill was perfectly complimented by roasted cauliflower and a smooth coriander beurre blanc. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of the Chestnut Baba dessert, you simply must taste it for yourself.\\n\\nLa Dame de Pic is a luxurious restaurant we’d wholeheartedly recommend to our clients. This is a must for impressive lunches, elite corporate dining and private events where only the best will do.</td>\n",

Amazing flavours in every dish that made me go WOW. Inventive use of meat parts(tongue etc). Received a hand written card from the team to celebrate our birthday which was a nice touch! Vibe is quite formal. I am dreaming of the day I can come back for another visit!   \n",

The restaurant is situated within a top hotel and specialises in Southern/South East French cuisine. Which is understandable as Chef Pic is from that heritage. My wife and I visited in July 2021 for our wedding anniversary.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe food is stupendous. Tasty. Creative. And a sight and wonder to behold. For the taste buds, the eyes, and for all the senses indeed. Furthermore, service is impeccable. The staff are friendly, professional, courteous yet impeccably trained and oh so knowledgeable on the restaurant's various dishes. Most impressive. I was most impressed by Stephanie, Art and Walter especially. Job well done! I especially liked the attention to detail by the team. Stephanie's team noticed I was on my wedding anniversary meal and took appropriate action. Most impressive! I have decided I will spend my anniversaries here every year from henceforth! Imagine if you came here to propose marriage to your loved one!\\n\\nCons: None really. Prices are fair in view of the quality of the food and establishment. Lovely high ceilings. Staff did not rush me at all. The soap dispenser on the left hand side ran out of soap in the men's toilet, but really, I can't find any flaw or fault in the restaurant. Well done!\\n\\nIn short, Dame De Pic is the London outpost of Chef Pic's international Michelin starred gastronomic empire and serves superb French food. I had a great time there, would recommend it unreservedly and look forward to visiting them again soon for great tasting French food. Well done guys!   \n",

HOWEVER, the timings  and delivery of each pairing was wrong, and it ruined the experience of each dish ( which is the point of paring option). The pairings were served 10-15 mins before each course, and with many of the pairings needing to be serviced chilled, they were warm by the time the food arrived. This completely ruined our experience.\\n\\nAfter getting the attention of our waiter, he continued to time his pour wrong.  Finally we spoke to one of the senior managers, who informed me that the kitchen failed to communicate with front of house, and offered our cocktails on the house as an apology.\\n\\nSadly, it doesn’t rectify the failure, and at a cost in excess of £600.   \n",

       "12  Luxurious lunching at La Dame de Pic\\nLondon has no shortage of excellent restaurants and the city hosts some fine examples of gastronomy taken to the next level. La Dame de Pic at the opulent Four Seasons hotel at Ten Trinity square is a venue set to impress the most discerning of diners. Anne-Sophie Pic is one of the World’s most decorated female Michelin star chefs and this truly beautiful restaurant is befitting of her culinary excellence.\\n\\nUpon arrival at the Four Seasons hotel, we were instantly impressed by the tasteful grandiosity of the building. Deep carpets felt pleasing under foot and the tall walls featured an artistically crafted fresco set into the plaster. We passed garlands of fresh flowers to enter the central bar, featuring a grand piano at the middle of its lavish rounded room. This building was formerly the Port of London Authority headquarters and retains much of its original décor. La Dame de Pic features high ceilings and columns set with bevelled mirrors, bathing the restaurant with natural light. Guests are given plenty of space and seated on rich leather furniture. We got a glimpse of the intimate private room, which reflects the charm of the building and can accommodate 14 guests for a truly special dining experience. The venue is impressive without being stuffy and the warm, attentive staff are very relaxed and welcoming.\\n\\nAnne-Sophie Pic has a reputation for producing exceptional dishes and we couldn’t wait to sample her creations. The restaurant features several menu options, ranging from a set lunch menu starting at a very reasonable £32 for two Michelin Starred courses, to an indulgent six course tasting menu, for those wanting a truly heavenly experience. We picked a four-course lunch option which featured a tour de force of cooking. The fresh cheese gnocchi paired with a velvety-smooth pepper emulsion and wild mushrooms was an amazing opener. The foie gras terrine was the richest we’ve tasted, melting on the palette with a pineapple and cardamom chutney. A Scottish scallop with smoked beetroot and grapefruit was cooked to other-worldly standards, converting a former beetroot avoider to rave about this course. A duck breast smoked with vanilla was the most perfectly cooked example we’ve tasted, with the fat beautifully rendered and the meat pleasingly pink and juicy. A delicate fillet of Cornish Brill was perfectly complimented by roasted cauliflower and a smooth coriander beurre blanc. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of the Chestnut Baba dessert, you simply must taste it for yourself.\\n\\nLa Dame de Pic is a luxurious restaurant we’d wholeheartedly recommend to our clients. This is a must for impressive lunches, elite corporate dining and private events where only the best will do.   \n",

Of course the story (history) is very important, but first of all the purpose of the visit is food and stile of cooking.\\nYou will not find something here, and if you will visit some fine dining places in Bilbao and Basque Region your experience will be much better. Quality of cooking maybe the subject of discussion, but bones in duck meat is a failure.\\nThe egg course (this time marble) is perfect, no starch (potato) opens new flavours of this popular in fine dinning course.   \n",

I also own their cookbooks, but more like coffee table books. A lot of time and effort goes in to these recipes.   \n",

I had the oyster cream of Chantilly, cod, lobster wrapped in shiitake, and the brown sugar tart as dessert.\\n\\nThe cream of Chantilly was refreshing and holds all the flavors. The cod was cooked to perfection. And I was surprised by the use of tapioca in the sauce and yet it accompanied the fish very well. My favorite was the lobster. I’ve never thought it goes so will the the shiitake. The mushroom tasted like the sun dried ones and added a trace of bitter sound flavor to the lobster. Such food pairing is not even common in Eastern Asian dishes. The brown sugar tart tastes like creme brûlée and the best part of the dessert is the stem ginger ice cream. It’s spicy to the exact right strength.\\n\\nThe service is attentive the nice. I don’t mind if it’s a bit more casual.   \n",

Food was so delicious. Superb presentation. High cuisine techniques and flavour combinations. Incredible value for money - 3 dish set lunch at a 2 Michelin star restaurant in central London for £45 - an absolute bargain! Complementary starters (3 different bite size eats), complementary bread and flavoured butter, and complementary tarts. Super nice and profesional staff. Great ambience and lots of natural light and space. I cannot fault it. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.   \n",

Every dish served was a piece of artwork carefully cooked and presented. Though some of the taste were not my cup of tea. There were some in the Christmas set which I was truly in love with, such as the lobster soup(served cold), cod, and the lamb shoulder. Some food is best to be served cold so you can taste the most flavor out of it - perfectly demonstrated by the lobster soup. The cod was the finest cod I’ve had in London, very tender which made a great combination with the sauce. However, surprise never stopped in the Ledbury, the milk-fed lamb shoulder was super tender and flavorsome. I really hope that they had more of it on my plate(there was also lamb legs which was also tender but not as good as the shoulder). The Christmas tart was a nice combination of ginger and cinnamon, a good seasonal treat for the end of a nice Christmas meal. If you were to try the normal set, the brown sugar tart is a must try!!!\\nPS. One of my friend really appreciated their bread, and the restaurant gave us a whole loaf to take home for free!!!

Incredible food; the chefs led by Brett Graham have designed each course of the tasting menu (regular and vegetarian) to be outstanding and completely different from each other. The curd of buffalo milk with truffle toast is a favourite as is the passion fruit souffle with sauternes ice cream.\\nThe wine pairings are chosen very well by a good sommelier who really knows each wine.\\nRelaxed atmosphere and great service from friendly staff.\\nI have been there twice for the tasting menu with wine pairings and plan to return soon. I believe this should get the third star in the near future; it'll be be well deserved!</td>\n",

       "44                                                       This restaurant definitely lives up to its fame - a Michelin two starred. Upon entry, you’d already be attracted by its fancy decorations and elegant ambience. Every dish served was a piece of artwork carefully cooked and presented. Though some of the taste were not my cup of tea. There were some in the Christmas set which I was truly in love with, such as the lobster soup(served cold), cod, and the lamb shoulder. Some food is best to be served cold so you can taste the most flavor out of it - perfectly demonstrated by the lobster soup. The cod was the finest cod I’ve had in London, very tender which made a great combination with the sauce. However, surprise never stopped in the Ledbury, the milk-fed lamb shoulder was super tender and flavorsome. I really hope that they had more of it on my plate(there was also lamb legs which was also tender but not as good as the shoulder). The Christmas tart was a nice combination of ginger and cinnamon, a good seasonal treat for the end of a nice Christmas meal. If you were to try the normal set, the brown sugar tart is a must try!!!\\nPS. One of my friend really appreciated their bread, and the restaurant gave us a whole loaf to take home for free!!! This pushed my expectation of ‘service’ to a whole new level. Well done!!!   \n",

The service, the food, everything is on point. The staff are nice and very chatty which is nice and it’s not too stuffy that you don’t feel comfortable which I find with a lot of fine dining restaurants in UK. Not having a dress code yet the atmosphere is warm and very cosy. The presentation of food is what is expected of a fine dining restaurant, the taste is great. Loved executed dish expect for Deer. But it could be that I was already too full by the time I got there and I personally am not a fan of anything too Gamey in taste. The restaurant catered for my partners onion and garlic minor allergy by excluding it in his meal which is very nice as it’s sometimes quite hard to cater for that. Overall a very nice restaurant & would def go back when the menu is updated as it’s a degustation only so not much to choose from really but they do cater if there is a dish you don’t like and more than happy to swap it out.   \n",

The food I feel is even better than on my last visit and the service as attentive as always.\\n\\nThis restaurant is one of the top restaurants in the world for a reason! Anybody who is lucky to get a table should definitely come and try it out for yourself you will not regret it (well not at least until you get the bill ^^)\\n\\nPs: and if you do get a chance try to say hello to the kitchen team and chef graham they deserve a big thank you too!\\n\\nOld review 2015:\\n\\nBooked for my birthday and it was the first time I ever visited a 2 star michelin star restaurant.\\n\\nI have to say I do really enjoyed the whole experience. The service was definitely one of the best I have ever experienced. The presentation of the food was also very nice.\\n\\nWe had the tasting menu and the lamb was probably the best I ever had in my life.\\n\\nThe only nick picking would be that a fruit fly landed into my wine glass but a staff member was helpful enough to fish it out for me.\\n\\nFor sure a restaurant worth visiting and recommending.\\n\\nCheers!   \n",

What more can I possibly add to the previous reviews singing your praises? One reviewer perfectly described the food as 'rightness.' All the flavours are fresh and unique and it's just fun to eat- the mackerel is superb. Perhaps the only thing I can add to all the other reviews is to praise the service. One of the managers was also American and spent a good deal of time talking to us about the menu (he knew EVERYTHING!), the restaurant's and chef's backgrounds, and just about restaurants in general and comparing the American and British food scenes. He was really friendly without being overbearing and seemed to genuinely love his work and want to make it an enjoyable evening for us. The staff literally anticipated everything and knew what we wanted before we did, which made the whole experience totally relaxing and you never had to worry about something going awry. These are clearly professionals. If I won the lottery tomorrow, the first thing I would do is go eat at the Ledbury. Actually, even if I don't win the lottery I will go back and eat at the Ledbury- it's worth it.   \n",

Incredible food; the chefs led by Brett Graham have designed each course of the tasting menu (regular and vegetarian) to be outstanding and completely different from each other. The curd of buffalo milk with truffle toast is a favourite as is the passion fruit souffle with sauternes ice cream.\\nThe wine pairings are chosen very well by a good sommelier who really knows each wine.\\nRelaxed atmosphere and great service from friendly staff.\\nI have been there twice for the tasting menu with wine pairings and plan to return soon.

They had only been open two days when we went, but the entire staff are engaging and warm. We were admiring the stunning photo series of Karl Lagerfeld and immediately offered a tour telling us about each one. They are part of a very exciting Afternoon Themed Tea which will be really fun.

And once again I left feeling the same this time.\\n\\nCanapés were beautiful and delicious as always. The uniqueness of the vodka and cocoa butter canapé always amazes me. The bread was freshly baked, with a great consistency; crisp and hard on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Served with it was a terrific celeriac amuse-bouche. The mackerel was fresh and was enhanced further by the sweet and sour flavours of the vinaigrette. Anne Sophie Pic's signature pasta dish Les Berlingots was impressive as predicted, filled with a warm, rich, creamy cheese sauce, accompanied by a delicately sweet pea broth.\\n\\nThe lobster with monks beard had the perfect texture but I felt this dish was slightly ruined by the fact there was a very bitter sauce at the bottom, which I believe was made from Pomelo Hirado. Unfortunately, it was so bitter that it became dominant throughout. The monkfish meunière was excellent; the fish was cooked beautifully with the right level of seasoning, served alongside a selection of tender but crunchy vegetables. An ideal combination! The meat course consisted of guinea fowl with tonka. It was incredibly tender and soft. The tonka added a nice aroma to the dish, though the meat itself could have seen a little more seasoning, it was slightly bland. Nevertheless, this was one of the best guinea fowl dishes I have eaten, though I personally prefer other birds like duck and chicken.\\n\\nThe Gariguette strawberry dessert was a work of art and could not be more representative of the spring season; vibrant, refreshing, simple and light. Desserts here have always been a firm favourite of mine and continue to be, for good reason.\\n\\nThis was again a fabulous evening. The dishes were light and elegant, demonstrating Anne Sophie Pic's distinctive and creative cuisine. Many of the dishes had pleasant aromas, owing to the use of ingredients such as pepper and tea. La Dame de Pic continues to be one of my favourite restaurants and I always thoroughly look forward to dining here ;)\\n\\nA fourth visit???....... Oh yes</td>\n",

Where else to have your wedding meal with mother and father in law(it was a very small affair)? A great meal is a mix of wonderful food and tastes, the people you’re with with and the place.

       "109  This was my third time eating here, having been totally blown away by the food on my first and second visits. And once again I left feeling the same this time.\\n\\nCanapés were beautiful and delicious as always. The uniqueness of the vodka and cocoa butter canapé always amazes me. The bread was freshly baked, with a great consistency; crisp and hard on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Served with it was a terrific celeriac amuse-bouche. The mackerel was fresh and was enhanced further by the sweet and sour flavours of the vinaigrette. Anne Sophie Pic's signature pasta dish Les Berlingots was impressive as predicted, filled with a warm, rich, creamy cheese sauce, accompanied by a delicately sweet pea broth.\\n\\nThe lobster with monks beard had the perfect texture but I felt this dish was slightly ruined by the fact there was a very bitter sauce at the bottom, which I believe was made from Pomelo Hirado. Unfortunately, it was so bitter that it became dominant throughout. The monkfish meunière was excellent; the fish was cooked beautifully with the right level of seasoning, served alongside a selection of tender but crunchy vegetables. An ideal combination! The meat course consisted of guinea fowl with tonka. It was incredibly tender and soft. The tonka added a nice aroma to the dish, though the meat itself could have seen a little more seasoning, it was slightly bland. Nevertheless, this was one of the best guinea fowl dishes I have eaten, though I personally prefer other birds like duck and chicken.\\n\\nThe Gariguette strawberry dessert was a work of art and could not be more representative of the spring season; vibrant, refreshing, simple and light. Desserts here have always been a firm favourite of mine and continue to be, for good reason.\\n\\nThis was again a fabulous evening. The dishes were light and elegant, demonstrating Anne Sophie Pic's distinctive and creative cuisine. Many of the dishes had pleasant aromas, owing to the use of ingredients such as pepper and tea. La Dame de Pic continues to be one of my favourite restaurants and I always thoroughly look forward to dining here ;)\\n\\nA fourth visit???....... Oh yes   \n",
